**Why “gentle first” matters.** Holistic health works best when it’s simple, consistent, and eco-aware…

### 1) Sleep & Circadian Rhythm
- Morning light exposure 5–10 minutes.
- Low blue light after sunset; warm lamps, dim screens.

### 2) Stress Regulation
- 4-7-8 breathing (4 in, 7 hold, 8 out) for 5 cycles.
- 10-minute nature walk: mood + HRV support.

### 3) Digestion Basics
- Eat slowly, chew thoroughly, aim for fibre diversity (veg, legumes, whole grains).
- Ginger or peppermint tea after meals can ease mild bloating.

### 4) Immune Foundations
- Regular sleep, movement, and whole foods outcompete supplements for most people.
- Honey + lemon in warm water may soothe a mild sore throat. (Avoid honey for infants.)

### 5) Herbal Spotlights (eco-aware)
- **Chamomile**: wind-down tea; may aid sleep.
- **Ginger**: nausea & digestion support.
- **Peppermint**: tension-headache relief (topical oil, diluted).

### Safety & Sourcing
- Buy from reputable, sustainable brands; avoid wild overharvesting.
- Check medication interactions (especially pregnancy/breastfeeding).

**Bottom line:** start small, go consistent, and favour low-impact options first.
