Fermented foods have been part of traditional diets for centuries. They’re **alive** with friendly microbes and **tasty** once you find the styles you like. You don’t need a perfect diet — just a few steady, enjoyable habits.

## Great beginner options
- **Live yoghurt** (look for “live cultures” on label)
- **Kefir** (pourable yoghurt; mildly tangy)
- **Sauerkraut** (raw, unpasteurised; crunchy, salty)
- **Kimchi** (spicy fermented cabbage; great with rice/eggs)

## What to look for (and avoid)
- **“Live” or “active cultures”** on the label
- **Refrigerated** products are more likely to be alive
- **Short ingredient lists** (veg, salt, spices)
- **Avoid**: added sugars, pasteurised sauerkraut (often shelf-stable)

## Easy daily habit ideas
- Spoon of **kefir** in your morning smoothie
- **Yoghurt** bowl with berries/nuts
- **Sauerkraut/kimchi** as a small side with lunch or dinner
- Rotate types each week for variety

## Simple starter picks

- Fermentation jar kit (airlock lids):

- Mandoline/knife + salt (for kraut):

> If you’re new to fermentation at home, start small. Keep jars clean, use enough salt, and refrigerate when taste/texture hits your sweet spot.

## A note on balance
Fermented foods can be a **helpful piece** of gut health alongside fibre (veg, beans, oats), movement, sleep, and stress care. If you have GI conditions, consult your clinician before making big changes.
