Living eco-friendly doesn’t have to be complicated 🌱. With a few mindful changes at home, you can make a big difference for the planet *and* your wellbeing.

## 1. Reduce Single-Use Plastics
Swap plastic bags, bottles, and cling film for reusable alternatives like glass jars, stainless steel bottles, and beeswax wraps.

## 2. Save Energy Daily
Turn off lights when leaving a room, switch to LED bulbs, and unplug chargers when not in use. These small actions lower bills and carbon footprint.

## 3. Green Cleaning
Use natural cleaners like vinegar, baking soda, and lemon. They’re safer for your health and reduce harsh chemicals in your home.

## 4. Compost Kitchen Waste
Instead of sending food scraps to landfill, compost them. This reduces methane emissions and creates rich soil for your plants.

## Final Thoughts
Start small — one habit at a time. Over weeks, eco-friendly choices will become second nature and contribute to a healthier planet 🌍.
