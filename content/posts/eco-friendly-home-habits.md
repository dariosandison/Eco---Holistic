Living eco-friendly isn’t about perfection — it’s about consistency. These small habits can support your holistic lifestyle while reducing environmental impact:

### 1) Choose natural cleaners
DIY solutions like vinegar + lemon work as well as harsh chemicals.

### 2) Open windows daily
Fresh air clears toxins and supports circadian rhythm.

### 3) Use beeswax or soy candles
Avoid paraffin — it releases petroleum byproducts.

### 4) Indoor plants
Peace lilies and spider plants filter air naturally.

### 5) Reusable over disposable
From water bottles to cloth towels, cut waste at the source.

### 6) Cook from scratch
Less packaging, better nutrition.

### 7) Mindful energy use
Switch off devices at night, let in natural light.

**Bottom line:** A healthier home is one that works with nature, not against it.
