Water is essential, but **hydration = water + electrolytes**. If you sweat, train, sit in saunas, or just feel “flat,” a small bump in **sodium, potassium, and magnesium** can help — without piling on sugar.

## Signs you might benefit
- You drink plenty yet feel **thirsty, headachy, or crampy**  
- Afternoon **fatigue** even with decent sleep  
- Frequent sauna/cold/plenty of training

## A simple daily approach
- **Start the day** with a large glass of water + a pinch of sea salt.  
- Add an **electrolyte mix** for workouts/sauna days (no sugar needed).  
- Eat mineral-rich foods: potatoes, beans, leafy greens, yoghurt.

## DIY “clean” mix (no flavours)
In 500–700 ml water:
- A **pinch of fine sea salt** (sodium)  
- **1/8–1/4 tsp potassium citrate** (potassium)  
- **100–200 mg magnesium** (glycinate or citrate, as tolerated)

> Adjust to taste and your activity level. If you have kidney/heart conditions or take medications, ask your clinician before changing electrolytes.

## Store-bought, minimal-additive picks
- Unflavoured electrolyte powders (no sugar):

- Potassium citrate:

- Magnesium glycinate:

## What to avoid (for everyday use)
- **High-sugar sports drinks** (spikes then crashes)  
- **Artificial colours/sweeteners** if you’re sensitive  
- **Overdoing potassium** — more isn’t better; keep doses modest

Hydration is a habit, not a one-off fix. Keep it simple, clean, and consistent.
