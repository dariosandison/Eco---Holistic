## Why Magnesium Types, Simplified: Sleep, Stress & Muscles matters
Magnesium Types, Simplified: Sleep, Stress & Muscles can play a role in a whole-person approach to wellbeing when paired with foundational habits like sleep, movement, and stress management. Below is a simple, practical guide you can adapt to your lifestyle.

If you’ve ever stared at a supplement shelf wondering *which* magnesium to buy, you’re not alone. The right type depends on the *job* you want it to do — and how your stomach handles it.

## Quick chooser
- **For wind-down & sleep:** *Magnesium glycinate*
- **For muscle tension & general use:** *Glycinate* or *malate*
- **For occasional constipation:** *Magnesium citrate* (osmotic — draws water into the bowel)
- **Avoid:** *Magnesium oxide* as your main form (poorly absorbed, can upset stomach)

## How much?
- Typical daily range: **200–400 mg elemental magnesium**.
- Start lower if you’re sensitive (100–150 mg) and increase slowly.

> **Elemental magnesium** is the actual magnesium you get. Labels often list the compound weight (e.g., “magnesium glycinate 1000 mg”), but show elemental in a smaller line. Aim for 200–400 mg **elemental** per day from food + supplements combined.

## Clean-label picks (minimal additives)
- Magnesium glycinate capsules:

- Magnesium citrate powder (easy to titrate):

- Magnesium malate (daytime, gentle):

**Check labels** for short ingredient lists (magnesium compound + capsule material like cellulose). Skip artificial dyes and “proprietary blends.”

## What to expect
- **Glycinate:** many find it calming with fewer GI issues. Good in the evening.
- **Citrate:** helpful for regularity; too much can cause loose stools.
- **Malate:** gentle daytime option; some feel smoother energy.

## Food first
Leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and legumes are rich in magnesium. Supplements can fill gaps but don’t replace a varied diet.
