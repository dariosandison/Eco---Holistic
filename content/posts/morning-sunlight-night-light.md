Great sleep isn’t only about what happens at bedtime. Your **body clock** is set by light across the whole day. Two simple tweaks make a big difference: **morning sunlight** and **gentle evenings**.

## The 10–3–1 rule (easy version)
- **10 minutes** of outdoor light soon after waking (2–10 min on bright days, 10–20 on cloudy).  
- **3 hours** before bed: aim for warmer, dimmer lights.  
- **1 hour** before bed: screens down or use warm/night modes.

> Outdoor light is 10–100× stronger than indoor light even on grey days. Through windows doesn’t count as much — step outside if you can.

## Night light hygiene
- Swap cool-white bulbs for **warm (2700K or less)** in the evening.  
- Use lamps at **eye-level or lower** (avoid ceiling glare).  
- On phones/screens: enable **Night Shift/Night Mode** in the evening.

## Helpful, simple tools
- Warm LED bulbs (2700K or “warm white”):

- Blue-light-reduced glasses (evening use only, optional):

## Bonus habits
- **Caffeine**: finish by early afternoon to protect deep sleep.  
- **Late meals**: keep lighter and earlier when possible.  
- **Bedroom**: cool, dark, and quiet (or use a fan/white noise).

Small changes stack: try the 10–3–1 rule for 7 days and see how you feel.
