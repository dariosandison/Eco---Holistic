## Why Creatine for Brain & Everyday Energy (Not Just for the Gym) matters
Creatine for Brain & Everyday Energy (Not Just for the Gym) can play a role in a whole-person approach to wellbeing when paired with foundational habits like sleep, movement, and stress management. Below is a simple, practical guide you can adapt to your lifestyle.

Creatine is one of the few supplements with decades of research behind it. Most people hear “creatine” and think of weight rooms — but your **brain** uses creatine too. If your days involve problem-solving, short bursts of effort, or you simply want a bit more consistent energy, creatine monohydrate is a low-cost, low-fuss option to consider.

> **TL;DR**: Look for *plain creatine monohydrate*, 3–5 g once daily, ideally the micronized/unflavoured kind. Avoid “proprietary blends” and unnecessary additives.

## Why creatine helps
Your cells use ATP as quick energy. Creatine acts like a battery helper — it **recycles ATP** faster during short, demanding efforts (think sprints, a hard set in the gym, or even a focused burst of mental work). Many people also report fewer afternoon energy dips after a week or two of daily use.

## How to use it
- **Dose:** 3–5 g per day (roughly 1 level teaspoon). No “loading phase” required.
- **Timing:** Any time works. Consistency matters more than timing.
- **Mix:** In water, a smoothie, or yoghurt. Micronized powders dissolve easier.
- **How long:** Daily for at least 3–4 weeks before judging effects.

## What to avoid (and why)
- **“Creatine blends” or pre-workouts** — usually pricier with sweeteners and fillers.
- **Creatine HCL/“fancy forms”** — fine but typically **no practical advantage** vs. monohydrate for most people, and they cost more.
- **Flavoured versions** — often add sugars, sweeteners, dyes.

## Simple picks (minimal ingredients)
- Plain, micronized creatine monohydrate:

- Creapure® (a well-regarded quality standard):

> Tip: Check the ingredients list — it should basically say **“Creatine Monohydrate”** and nothing else.

## Common questions
**Will it make me bulky?**
No. Creatine can draw a bit of water into muscle cells (often 0.5–1.5 kg), but that’s not the same as gaining fat or “bulking.”

**Is it safe?**
Creatine monohydrate has a strong safety record for healthy adults when used as directed. If you have a medical condition or take medications, talk to your healthcare provider first.

**Do I need to cycle off?**
Not necessary for most people. Some do occasional breaks just to check they still notice a benefit.
