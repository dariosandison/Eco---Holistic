Holistic health works best when it’s simple, consistent, and eco-aware. Here are five gentle practices:

### 1) Sleep & Circadian Rhythm
- Morning light 5–10 minutes.
- Limit screens after sunset.

### 2) Stress Regulation
- Try 4-7-8 breathing.
- 10-minute nature walk.

### 3) Digestion
- Chew slowly, eat whole foods.
- Ginger or peppermint tea.

### 4) Immunity
- Sleep, movement, whole foods first.
- Honey + lemon for sore throat.

### 5) Herbal Spotlights
- Chamomile: sleep.
- Ginger: digestion.
- Peppermint: headache relief.

Start small, go consistent, and favour low-impact options.
