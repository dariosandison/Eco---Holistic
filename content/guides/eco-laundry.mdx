# Eco Laundry

Clean clothes, lower impact.

## TL;DR
- Wash **cold** where possible; **40°C** for towels/sheets.
- Dose **by water hardness**; over‑dosing increases residue.
- Air‑dry; use **dryer balls** if you tumble.

## Tips
- Pre‑treat stains; don’t oversoak elastics.
- Capture microfibres with a **wash bag**.
