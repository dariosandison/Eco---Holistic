> **TL;DR:** Use a **liquid concentrate** or **powder** (not pods), wash cold, and catch microfibres with a wash bag or filter.

## Why this matters for holistic wellbeing

The choices you make around **eco laundry** affect more than convenience — they influence indoor air quality, potential irritants, stress levels, and your environmental footprint. This guide emphasises simple habit changes that support your health first; products are optional helpers.

## Practical routine to start today

1. **Simplify** — remove the extras you rarely use; fewer products means fewer exposures.
2. **Swap the highest‑impact item first** — choose fragrance‑free or naturally scented options and short ingredient lists.
3. **Ventilate** — fresh air reduces build‑up of indoor pollutants from cooking, cleaning, and off‑gassing.
4. **Be consistent** — small, repeated choices around eco laundry add up.

## Ingredient red flags to avoid

- **"Fragrance/Parfum" catch‑all** — can hide dozens of chemicals; choose fully disclosed scents or fragrance‑free.
- **Harsh disinfectants for daily use** — reserve quats/strong biocides for when they are truly needed.
- **Unnecessary dyes & brighteners** — cosmetic only; they add exposure without benefit.
- **Greenwashing terms** — “non‑toxic”, “chemical‑free”, “eco‑friendly” without specifics. Prefer full ingredient lists or credible standards.

## Research snapshot

- Lower product complexity and proper ventilation correlate with **better indoor air quality**.
- People sensitive to fragrance report fewer symptoms when **fragrance‑free** policies are adopted.
- Choosing durable, repairable items generally has **lower lifecycle impact** than frequent replacement.

_These are broad findings intended for context, not medical advice._

## Sources & further reading

- Public health guidance on indoor air quality and fragrance sensitivity.
- Consumer chemical safety databases (e.g., EU CLP, EWG ingredient entries) and lifecycle assessments.
- Independent lab tests and standards bodies relevant to the category.

## Optional products we like (use if they truly help)

Start with the routine above first. Products are helpful extras, not requirements.
