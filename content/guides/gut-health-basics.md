## A simple 7-day gut-friendly pattern
- **Daily plants goal:** hit **10+ different plants/week** (fruit, veg, beans, nuts, seeds, herbs).
- **Fiber upgrade:** oats or chia at breakfast; add **1 tsp psyllium** with water if needed.
- **Ferment a little:** a few forkfuls of sauerkraut or a glass of kefir with meals.
- **Protein with each meal** to steady energy and cravings.
- **Ultra-processed foods:** don’t panic—just swap one thing at a time for a simpler alternative.

## Easy swaps
- Sugary cereal → **oats + nuts + fruit**
- Soda → **sparkling water + lemon**
- Creamy sauces → **olive oil + herbs + lemon**
- Crisps nightly → **mixed nuts** a few nights/week

## DIY ferments (faster than you think)
- **Kraut:** shred cabbage, 2% salt by weight, pack in jar, weight it down, lid on with airlock. Taste from day 5.
- **Kefir:** add starter to milk or coconut milk, leave 24h, chill, drink.

## Our picks
- **Psyllium husk** for a gentle fiber bump.
- **Fermentation weights + lids** to make kraut easy.
- **Kefir starter** for a daily probiotic drink.
