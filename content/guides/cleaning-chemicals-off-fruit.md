faq:
  - q: "Soap or detergent?"
    a: "No—stick to **potable water**, friction, and optional baking-soda soaks. Soap isn’t meant for produce."
  - q: "Vinegar?"
    a: "A **diluted white-vinegar spritz** (then rinse) can cut surface microbes on firmer veg. Skip on delicate berries."
  - q: "Peeling?"
    a: "Peeling removes wax/skin residues but also fibre and nutrients. Wash well first; peel if you prefer."
  - q: "Pre-wash then store?"
    a: "Greens can be washed/spun/dried and stored in a breathable box with paper towel. Berries last longer if washed just before eating."

You don’t need special chemicals to clean produce. **Running water + friction** does most of the work. Here’s a quick routine that’s easy to stick to.

## The simple method (everyday)
1. **Hands first:** wash your hands.  
2. **Rinse under running water:** cool, not hot (hot can wilt).  
3. **Friction:** use a **soft produce brush** for firm skins; rub delicate fruit gently with your hands.  
4. **Dry well:** spin greens; pat fruit with a clean towel.

## Optional baking-soda soak (for greens/berries)
- Fill a bowl with cool water.  
- Add **~1 tsp baking soda**.  
- Swirl in produce for **~30–60 sec**, then rinse under running water.  
- Dry thoroughly (spinner for leaves; towel for fruit).

## Optional diluted vinegar spritz (firm produce)
- Add **1 part white vinegar to 3 parts water** in a **glass spray bottle**.  
- Lightly spray apples/cucumbers/peppers, rub, and rinse.  
- Don’t use on delicate berries or porous mushrooms.

## Tips that help most
- **Brush beats “miracle washes.”** Friction removes wax and grime.  
- **Wash just before eating** (except pre-washed leafy batches you dry well).  
- **Store dry** to avoid slime—spinners are worth it.

## Our picks
- A **soft produce brush**, **baking soda**, a **salad spinner**, and an optional **vinegar spray bottle**.
