faq:

  a: "No\u2014stick to **potable water**, friction, and optional baking-soda soaks.\
    \ Soap isn\u2019t meant for produce."
- q: Vinegar?
  a: A **diluted white-vinegar spritz** (then rinse) can cut surface microbes on firmer
    veg. Skip on delicate berries.
- q: Peeling?
  a: Peeling removes wax/skin residues but also fibre and nutrients. Wash well first;
    peel if you prefer.
- q: Pre-wash then store?
  a: Greens can be washed/spun/dried and stored in a breathable box with paper towel.
    Berries last longer if washed just before eating.
