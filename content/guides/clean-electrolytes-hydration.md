Most days, water + minerals is enough. Skip the candy-sweet formulas.

## What to avoid
- **Artificial colours/sweeteners** if you prefer a clean profile.
- **Very high sugar** mixes unless you’re doing long endurance sessions.

## Better options
- **Unsweetened or lightly sweetened** electrolyte powders.
- **Electrolyte drops** (easy in a bottle).
- DIY: water + **pinch of sea salt** + squeeze of citrus; add a little honey if needed.
