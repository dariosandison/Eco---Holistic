Perfection isn’t the goal — **steady, low‑effort habits are**. This guide focuses on the few moves that cut the most exposure and clutter while keeping your routine simple.

### Start here (first 90 days)
1. **Tackle daily touchpoints:** Upgrade the one thing you handle most (e.g., cookware, storage, cleanser).
2. **Create a “no‑overwhelm” rule:** One swap per month; set a reminder to revisit after 30 days.
3. **Make maintenance obvious:** Keep refills and filters where you’ll see them so the habit sticks.

> **Why it matters**  
> Heat and time increase leaching and breakdown. Moving plastics away from heat and choosing durable materials reduces exposure without changing your recipes or routines.

> **TL;DR:** Ventilate during and after high-moisture tasks, vacuum with a HEPA filter weekly, and use low-VOC products.

## Quick wins

- **Ventilation:** 10–20 minutes after shower/cooking.
- **Dust control:** vacuum with **HEPA** once a week.
- **Low-VOC products:** avoid heavy fragrance and aerosols.

## Helpful tools

- **HEPA vacuum** — sealed system.
- **Humidity monitor** — aim for **40–60% RH**.
- **Dehumidifier** if RH stays high.

## FAQ
**Is stainless, glass, or cast iron always better?**  
They’re durable and inert for most uses. Pick based on how you cook and clean.

**What if budget is tight?**  
Replace worn items first. Borrow, buy used, or upgrade one staple at a time.
