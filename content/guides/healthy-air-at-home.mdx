## Quick comparison

| What you want | Our pick | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Allergies / dust / pollen | True HEPA purifier | Captures fine particles effectively |
| Cooking fumes | Extractor + ventilation focus | Source control beats any purifier |
| Mould risk | Humidity control + airflow | Keep indoor humidity in a healthy range |

1. **Ventilation:** open‑window habit, especially after cooking/showering.  
2. **Humidity:** target **40–55% RH** to limit mould/viruses.  
3. **Particles (PM2.5):** from cooking, candles, dust; reduce and capture.  
4. **Chemicals/VOCs:** favour fragrance‑free, low‑solvent products.

## Quick checks
- Steam on windows? Increase ventilation or use extractor longer.  
- Musty smell? Inspect cold corners, behind furniture; keep 5–10 cm gap from exterior walls.  
- Greasy film in kitchen? Use lids, rear hobs, stronger extractor setting.

## Low‑cost moves
- **Microfibre + HEPA vacuum** weekly.  
- **Pan lids & back burners** reduce PM.  
- **Fragrance‑free** cleaners; avoid aerosol sprays.  
- **Door‑open purge**: 5–10 min cross‑breeze after high‑pollution activities.

## Purifiers (small rooms)
- Choose **HEPA‑class filter** with stated CADR.  
- Place **near source** (bedside, desk).  
- Replace filters on schedule; keep a calendar reminder.

## Humidity set‑up (winter)
- Use a **hygrometer**. Add a humidifier only if RH &lt;35% for long periods.  
- Clean tanks with vinegar weekly; use distilled water to cut mineral dust.

## Plants?
Nice, but rely on **ventilation + cleaning** for real air quality gains.

## Sleep routine
Air room 10 minutes, quiet purifier on low, keep RH ~45%.

## Quick comparison (at a glance)

| Option | Best for | Why it works |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Best overall | Most homes | Balanced performance, reliable materials, easy maintenance |
