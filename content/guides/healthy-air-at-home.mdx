Perfection isn’t the goal—steady, low-effort habits are. Below, we explain **why dust, VOCs, and moisture matter**, then give you a simple 90-day plan with **low-cost tools** and **when to consider an appliance**.

## What actually matters (and why)

**Particles (PM2.5)** irritate lungs and carry other pollutants. They spike during cooking, candles, and outdoor pollution days. Source control + ventilation + filtration is the stack that works.

**VOCs (volatile organic compounds)** come from cleaners, paints, fragrances, and some new furnishings. Venting at the source and switching products is more effective than gadgets alone.

**Moisture** drives condensation and mould. Keep indoor **relative humidity around 40–50%**; risk climbs **above ~60%**. Ventilate after showers/cooking; fix leaks fast.

## Start here (30 / 60 / 90 days)

### Days 1–30: immediate habits
- **Cook with extraction**: fan on, +10–15 minutes after. If no fan, crack a window during and after the cook.
- **Shower smart**: door closed while showering, fan on for 15–20 minutes after; keep lids on pans.
- **Weekly HEPA vacuum**: sealed system + soft brush for dust on skirtings, blinds, radiators (dust = particles).  
- **Product swap**: Replace one highly fragranced cleaner with a low-VOC alternative this month.

> TL;DR: Vent during/after moisture and smoke, vacuum weekly with HEPA, and avoid heavy fragrance/aerosols.

### Days 31–60: measure & maintain
- **Track humidity** with a **hygrometer** in bath/kitchen/bedroom. Aim **~40–50% RH**; investigate if **>60%** persists.  
- **Filter schedules**: write the date on filters for hoods, purifiers, and vacuums; set a 3-month reminder.

### Days 61–90: add tools if needed
- **Dehumidifier** if RH stays high: choose one rated for your room size and typical temp; run after showers/drying clothes.
- **Air purifier** for bedrooms/home office if you have allergies, live near traffic, or cook often. See criteria below.

## How to choose the right tools

### HEPA vacuum (sealed system)
**Why**: removes dust that otherwise becomes airborne.  
**Look for**: sealed body + HEPA bag/filter, crevice tools, 70–75 dB on low.

### Dehumidifier
**Why**: sustained RH >60% → condensation/mould risk.  
**Look for**: continuous drain option, quiet mode, auto-restart, simple filter cleaning. **Target RH ~45–50%.**

### Air purifier
**Why**: reduces PM2.5 in small rooms if you size correctly.  
**Look for**: **CADR sized to your room** (see calculator below), **True HEPA (H13)** or proven equivalent, **noise ≤30 dB** on sleep, and affordable filters.

#### Quick CADR sizing (rule of thumb)
- Room area (m²) × 2–3 = **minimum CADR (m³/h)** for 4–5 ACH in small bedrooms/offices.  
- Example: 12 m² room → 24–36 m³/h minimum; double if you want faster clean-up after cooking.

## FAQ

**Is stainless, glass or cast-iron always better?**  
They’re durable and inert for most uses; pick based on how you cook and clean.

**What humidity should I aim for?**  
**~40–50% RH** is comfortable; **>60%** increases condensation and mould risk.

**Do I need a purifier if I’ve got damp?**  
Tackle moisture first (leaks, ventilation, dehumidifier). Purifiers don’t solve damp/mould.

## How we research (no freebies required)
We don’t buy or lab‑test products. Instead we compile manufacturer specs, independent lab tests from reputable outlets, standards and agency guidance, and verified owner feedback. Where data is unclear, we explain the trade‑offs so you can decide with eyes open.
