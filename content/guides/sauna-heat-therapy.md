faq:
  - q: "How often should beginners use a sauna?"
    a: "Start with 1–2 sessions per week for 10–15 minutes and build gradually (e.g., up to 3–4 sessions of 15–20 minutes) as you feel comfortable."
  - q: "Infrared vs steam/traditional — which is better?"
    a: "Neither is universally ‘better’. Infrared runs at lower air temperatures and can feel gentler, while steam/traditional feel hotter and more humid. Choose what you’ll use consistently."
  - q: "What should I drink or eat around sessions?"
    a: "Hydrate before and after. Add electrolytes if you sweat heavily. A light, salty snack post-session can help; avoid alcohol."
  - q: "Who should avoid or talk to a doctor first?"
    a: "If you’re pregnant, have cardiovascular/low blood pressure issues, are ill/dehydrated, or take medications affecting heat tolerance, speak with a healthcare professional first."

Heat therapy has gone mainstream — and for good reason. When used sensibly, sauna time can support relaxation, circulation, workout recovery, and overall well-being. This guide keeps it **simple and practical** so you can start safely and stick with it.

## Key benefits (the short version)

- **Relaxation & sleep** — Warming up, then cooling down, nudges the nervous system toward calm. Many people report deeper sleep on sauna days.
- **Circulation & light cardiovascular work** — Your heart rate gently rises, similar to a very light jog. Regular sessions can complement normal training.
- **Muscle recovery** — Heat increases blood flow, which may help ease post-workout stiffness and support recovery habits (mobility, hydration, protein).
- **Mood** — The ritual itself (warmth + time away from screens) can be a simple way to reduce daily stress.

> None of this replaces medical care. If you have health concerns, check with a professional first.

## How to start (without overthinking it)

1. **Pick a format you’ll use**
   - *Infrared blanket*: lower air temps, cosy, easy to store.
   - *Portable steam tent*: warm, humid “mini steam room.”
   - *Traditional/gym sauna*: hottest feel; bring water, a towel, and a hat if it’s very hot.

2. **Ease in**
   - Begin with **10–15 minutes**, 1–2×/week.
   - Build to **15–20 minutes**, 2–4×/week if you feel good.

3. **Hydrate like an athlete**
   - Drink water **before and after**. Add electrolytes if you sweat a lot.
   - If you feel light-headed: exit, cool down, sip fluids.

4. **Cool down**
   - Sit in a cool room or take a lukewarm/cool shower. Let your body return to baseline.

## Safety first (common-sense rules)

- **Listen to your body**: dizziness, nausea, or headache = stop and cool down.
- **Skip sessions when ill or hungover.**
- **Medications & conditions**: if you’re on meds that affect heat tolerance (e.g., blood pressure meds) or you’re pregnant / have cardiovascular conditions, **get medical advice first**.
- **Cleanliness**: wipe equipment after each use; wash liners/covers regularly.

## What to look for when buying

- **Ease of use**: setup/pack-down time, wipe-clean surfaces, sturdy zips/velcro.
- **Practical temperatures**:
  - Infrared blanket: often **40–75°C** feels good for beginners.
  - Steam units: quick warm-up and visible steam output.
- **Timer & safety**: auto-off, overheat protection, and **CE/UKCA** markings.
- **Low maintenance**: removable liners or washable covers are worth it.
- **Accessories**: towel, **sauna hat**, thermometer/hygrometer (for cabins).
