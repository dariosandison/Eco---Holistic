## Why it matters
NEAT = **Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis** — all the movement that isn’t a workout (walking, chores, fidgeting). It quietly adds up and often improves energy and mood.

## Easy wins you’ll keep
- 5-minute walk calls; 10-minute errands on foot.  
- Park further away; take stairs one flight at a time.  
- 20 bodyweight squats while the kettle boils.  
- 2-minute stretch after each meeting.

## A gentle target
Hit your current average + 1,000 steps for two weeks.  
If it feels good, add another 1,000. Let it snowball.
