faq:
  - q: "Is mouth taping safe?"
    a: "Use **a tiny vertical strip** on the centre of the lips as a *reminder*, not a seal. **Do not use** if you have breathing difficulties, untreated sleep apnoea, nasal obstruction, or any concern—speak to a clinician first."
  - q: "Any daytime practice?"
    a: "Try relaxed nasal breathing on walks. Gentle habit during the day carries into sleep."
  - q: "What if my nose feels blocked?"
    a: "Saline spray, a warm shower, and tidying dust/pollen can help. If congestion persists, check in with a professional."

Nasal breathing can make sleep feel deeper and mornings clearer. The goal isn’t force—it’s **gentle cues** and a clearer nose.

## A calm setup
- **Tidy the air:** crack a window if air is fresh, or use a compact **HEPA purifier**.  
- **Clear the nose:** a **saline spray** before bed can help.  
- **Humid but not muggy:** if air is dry, a small humidifier on dry nights only.

## Gentle cue (optional)
- If it feels safe, place a **tiny vertical strip** of hypoallergenic **micropore tape** across the centre of closed lips as a reminder—not a seal. You should be able to open your mouth easily at any time.

## Daytime habit that helps at night
- **Walk & breathe through the nose** for 5–10 minutes, 1–2× daily.  
- Light posture work (chin tucked, long neck) keeps airways happy.

## Our picks
- **Micropore tape** (for a tiny, removable cue), **nasal strips**, **saline spray**, and a **compact HEPA purifier** if dust/pollen bother you.
