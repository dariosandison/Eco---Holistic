## Cookware
- Stainless steel, enamelled or well‑seasoned cast iron for most tasks.  
- Keep non‑stick for eggs only; use low heat and replace when scratched.

## Storage
- Glass containers for leftovers; silicone lids/bags for flexible storage.  
- Avoid hot food in plastic; cool first.

## Cleaning
- Fragrance‑free dish soap; ventilate while cooking.  
- Microfibre cloth + bicarb scrub for sinks and hobs.

## Food habits
- Plan 2–3 core meals; freeze portions; keep a “use‑me‑first” box in the fridge.

## FAQ
**Do I need to bin everything plastic?** No—use mindfully, avoid heat.
