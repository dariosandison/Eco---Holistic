> **TL;DR:** Start with what you use daily—dish soap, hand soap, all‑purpose cleaner, and food‑storage. Swap a few big offenders and you’ll cut most of your exposure.

## Essentials to swap first

- **Dish soap** — fragrance‑free, short ingredient lists.

- **All‑purpose cleaner** — concentrate + refillable bottle.

- **Hand soap** — unscented or essential‑oil only.

- **Food storage** — glass containers and silicone lids.

## Budget priorities

1. Finish what you have. Don’t bin usable product.  
2. Replace only when empty with a better option.  
3. Refill or buy concentrates where possible.
