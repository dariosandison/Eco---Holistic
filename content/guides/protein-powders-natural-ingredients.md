If you want to avoid artificial flavours and long additive lists, go **unflavoured** and mix in your own cacao, fruit, or spices. Look for whey with just lecithin, single-source pea/rice proteins, or simple collagen.

## How to Keep It Clean

- **Unflavoured first** — flavour with banana, berries, cinnamon, vanilla, or cacao.  
- **Whey**: “Concentrate” or “Isolate” + lecithin (sunflower/soy) — that’s usually it.  
- **Plant options**: single-source **pea** or **rice**. Blend them to balance amino acids.  
- **Collagen**: typically minimal ingredients; dissolves in hot or cold drinks.
