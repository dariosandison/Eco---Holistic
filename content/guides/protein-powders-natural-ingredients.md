## What to avoid — and why
- **Artificial sweeteners** (sucralose/acesulfame-K) if you’re sensitive to taste or GI effects.  
- **Heavy gum blends** (xanthan/guar/cellulose) — some tolerate fine; others feel bloated.  
- **Long “dessert” flavour labels** — more additives, less flexibility.

## What to look for — and why
- **Unflavoured or lightly sweetened** — add fruit/cocoa yourself.  
- **Single-ingredient options** (whey concentrate/isolate, pea, hemp).  
- **Transparent heavy-metals testing** when available.

## Straightforward picks (UK Amazon)
- **Unflavoured whey concentrate/isolate:**

### Mix like a pro
Blend with milk or milk-alt, a banana, cocoa, and a pinch of salt. Start with half a scoop if new to plant proteins.
