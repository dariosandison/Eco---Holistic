If the label reads like a science experiment, you can do better.

## What to avoid
- **Artificial sweeteners (e.g., sucralose, acesulfame-K)** if you prefer a clean taste.  
- **Multiple gums and thickeners** (a little is fine; long lists can feel chalky).  
- **Hidden oils** and dessert-style mixes when you want simple protein.

## Better picks by type
- **Whey isolate (unflavoured):** High protein, mixes easily.  
- **Pea protein (unflavoured):** Plant-based, neutral.  
- **Pumpkin/hemp/collagen:** Single-ingredient simplicity.

### Use it well
- Blend with banana + cinnamon; or shake with milk of choice.  
- For baking, start at **20–25 g** per recipe to keep texture soft.
