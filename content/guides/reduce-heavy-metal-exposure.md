faq:
  - q: "Do I need a ‘detox’ cleanse?"
    a: "No. True heavy metal poisoning is **medical**—see a clinician. At home, focus on reducing exposure (water, dust, food choices). Avoid unproven chelation or extreme cleanses."
  - q: "Which fish are lower in mercury?"
    a: "In general, choose **smaller/shorter-lived fish** more often (e.g., sardines, mackerel, trout) and keep large predatory fish occasional."
  - q: "What about fluoride?"
    a: "If you prefer to reduce it, pick a filter that **explicitly lists fluoride reduction**—not all do."
  - q: "Testing at home?"
    a: "If you suspect an issue, speak to your GP/clinician about appropriate testing rather than DIY kits."

You don’t need to overhaul your life to meaningfully reduce heavy-metal exposure. Focus on **water, dust, and sensible kitchen habits**.

## Water: the big, easy win
- Use an **NSF-certified filter** (pitcher or under-sink). Check labels for **lead/mercury** and (if you care) **fluoride** claims.  
- **Change cartridges on time.** Old filters stop working well.

## Dust: often overlooked
- **Vacuum with True HEPA** weekly, especially entryways and windowsills.  
- **Damp mop** hard floors (dust sticks to the cloth).  
- **Shoes off** at the door; a good doormat catches soil.

## Food choices that help
- **Fish rotation:** favour **smaller fish** more often; keep big predator fish occasional.  
- **Rinse produce** well (see our washing guide).  
- Use **glass or stainless** for hot/acidic foods; avoid old, chipped glazed ware for daily use.

## Home projects
- In older homes, **avoid dry-sanding old paint**; use a professional if lead paint is suspected.  
- Keep kids away from renovation zones; clean up with HEPA + damp wipe.

## Our picks
- An **NSF-certified water filter**, a **True HEPA vacuum**, and **glass/steel food storage** cover most of the benefit with minimal effort.
