You don’t need to overhaul your life to meaningfully reduce heavy-metal exposure. Focus on **water, dust, and sensible kitchen habits**.

## Water: the big, easy win
- Use an **NSF-certified filter** (pitcher or under-sink). Check labels for **lead/mercury** and (if you care) **fluoride** claims.
- **Change cartridges on time.** Old filters stop working well.

## Dust: often overlooked
- **Vacuum with True HEPA** weekly, especially entryways and windowsills.
- **Damp mop** hard floors (dust sticks to the cloth).
- **Shoes off** at the door; a good doormat catches soil.

## Food choices that help
- **Fish rotation:** favour **smaller fish** more often; keep big predator fish occasional.
- **Rinse produce** well (see our washing guide).
- Use **glass or stainless** for hot/acidic foods; avoid old, chipped glazed ware for daily use.

## Home projects
- In older homes, **avoid dry-sanding old paint**; use a professional if lead paint is suspected.
- Keep kids away from renovation zones; clean up with HEPA + damp wipe.

## Our picks
- An **NSF-certified water filter**, a **True HEPA vacuum**, and **glass/steel food storage** cover most of the benefit with minimal effort.
