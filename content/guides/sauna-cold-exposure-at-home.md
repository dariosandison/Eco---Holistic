## Why it matters (in plain English)
Alternating gentle heat and cool can feel deeply calming, help you unwind, and may support sleep quality for some people. You don’t need a built-in sauna or ice barrel — portable options make it doable in a flat with limited storage.

> **Keep it sensible:** If you feel unwell, stop. Speak to your clinician first if you’re pregnant, have heart/blood pressure issues, or any medical concerns.

## What to avoid
- “All out” sessions: more isn’t better.  
- Dehydration — drink water and add a pinch of salt if you’ve been sweating.  
- Ice-cold first exposures. Start cool, step down over weeks if you enjoy it.

## What to look for
- **Control:** adjustable temperature + timer.  
- **Cleanup:** wipe-clean materials and quick dry times.  
- **Comfort:** a mat or towel under your blanket/tent keeps things tidy.

## Quick picks
- Infrared sauna blanket for quiet, lie-down sessions.  
- Steam tent if you prefer a humid sweat.  
- Portable cold tub for short, refreshing dips.  
- Thermometer to track temps accurately.  
- A simple towel/hat set for comfort and cleanup.

## How to use well
- **Beginner plan (2–3×/week):** 10–15 min gentle heat → cool shower.  
- **Contrast days:** heat 10–15 min, cool 1–2 min, repeat once.  
- **Aftercare:** rinse, rehydrate, light snack with protein + carbs.
