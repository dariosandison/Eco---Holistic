**NEAT** = Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis—the calories you burn by **just moving more** in daily life. It’s surprisingly powerful.

## Easy wins
- **10k-ish steps** across the day (or just “more than yesterday”).
- **1–2 min movement breaks** every 30–60 min of sitting (timer helps).
- Carry shopping, take stairs, park farther away.
- Do chores **standing** or with a light **weighted vest/ankle weights**.

## At a desk
- Alternate **sit/stand**.
- Try a **light under-desk walk** during calls.
- Keep a **resistance band** within reach.
