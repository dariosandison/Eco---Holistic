  - "Creatine **monohydrate** (micronized mixes easiest)."
  - "Unflavoured powder with **one ingredient**."

faqs:
  - q: "Loading phase or not?"
    a: "Optional. Loading (20 g/day split for 5–7 days) saturates stores faster. Otherwise 3–5 g daily reaches the same place over a few weeks."
  - q: "When to take it?"
    a: "Any time works—habit matters more than timing."
  - q: "Is creatine only for lifters?"
    a: "Research also explores cognitive and fatigue effects. Still, always talk to a professional if you have medical questions."
