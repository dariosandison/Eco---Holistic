Want a cleaner routine with less plastic and fewer harsh ingredients? Build a small kit that just works.

## What to avoid (and why)
- **Single-use minis & bulky plastic** – more waste, higher cost per use.  
- **Strong synthetic fragrance** – can irritate skin; go unscented or essential-oil scented if you’re sensitive.  
- **Slippery bottles with pump leaks** – waste product and make a mess.

## Build your kit
- **Bar shampoo** – compact, travel-friendly, no bottle.  
- **Bar conditioner** – smooths and detangles without plastic.  
- **Refillable metal bottle** – pair with a gentle body-wash concentrate.  
- **Safety razor** – sturdy handle + replaceable blades = less waste.  
- **Natural-fiber cloth** – washable, gently exfoliating.  
- **Draining soap tray** – helps bars last longer.
