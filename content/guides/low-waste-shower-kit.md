Low-Waste Shower Kit can play a role in a whole-person approach to wellbeing when paired with foundational habits like sleep, movement, and stress management. Below is a simple, practical guide you can adapt to your lifestyle.

Want a cleaner routine with less plastic and fewer harsh ingredients? Build a small kit that just works.

## What to avoid (and why)
- **Single-use minis & bulky plastic** – more waste, higher cost per use.
- **Strong synthetic fragrance** – can irritate skin; go unscented or essential-oil scented if you’re sensitive.
- **Slippery bottles with pump leaks** – waste product and make a mess.

## Build your kit
- **Bar shampoo** – compact, travel-friendly, no bottle.
- **Bar conditioner** – smooths and detangles without plastic.
- **Refillable metal bottle** – pair with a gentle body-wash concentrate.
- **Safety razor** – sturdy handle + replaceable blades = less waste.
- **Natural-fiber cloth** – washable, gently exfoliating.
- **Draining soap tray** – helps bars last longer.
