## What to avoid — and why
- **Microbeads/microplastics** in scrubs — unnecessary abrasion + environmental load.  
- **Strong synthetic fragrances** if you’re sensitive.  
- **Single-use plastic** when a bar/refill works as well.

## What to look for — and why
- **Solid bars** (soap, shampoo, conditioner) → less packaging, travel-friendly.  
- **Refill pouches** for body wash if you prefer liquids.  
- **Safety razor** → close shave, low long-term cost.

### Make it stick
Let bars dry between uses, buy blades in bulk, and track what actually runs out (often less than you think).
