## Why go low-waste?
Cutting plastic in the bathroom is one of the easiest ways to lower household waste. Bars last longer, refillables save money, and you avoid unnecessary ingredients.

## Starter kit (swaps that work)

## How to switch without the faff
1. Finish what you have first (no need to bin half-full bottles).
2. Try one change per week (e.g., shampoo bar → then razor).
3. Store bars dry; they’ll last 2–3× longer.
