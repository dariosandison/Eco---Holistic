## Start with your goal
- **Taste & odour only:** jug or tap‑mount carbon filter.  
- **Limescale:** look for **ion‑exchange** or **scale** cartridges.  
- **Broad contaminant reduction:** under‑sink carbon block or **RO** (reverse osmosis).

## Types at a glance
- **Jug/bench‑top:** low cost, frequent cartridge changes.  
- **Under‑sink carbon block:** good flow, multi‑point reduction.  
- **RO systems:** most thorough; needs space, waste line, remineralisation for taste.  
- **Gravity systems:** no plumbing; slow but reliable for chlorine/particulates.

## UK specifics
- Most mains water is microbiologically safe; you’re optimising **taste, scale and some by‑products**.  
- Check supplier water reports; decide if RO is warranted or overkill.

## Maintenance matters
- Filters work **only** when replaced on schedule. Mark your calendar.  
- Sanitise housings when changing cartridges.

## FAQ
**Kettle fur?** A small in‑line scale filter or jug can dramatically reduce it.
