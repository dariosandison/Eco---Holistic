# Water Filter Buying Guide (UK)

Different water issues need different tools—start with your **water report** and goals.

## TL;DR
- For **taste/odor**: **carbon block** pitcher/under‑sink (NSF/ANSI **42**).
- For **lead/nitrates**: filters certified to **NSF/ANSI 53/58/401**.
- For **limescale**: softening or **scale‑control media**; RO if you also need broad contaminant reduction.

## Key Decisions
- **Countertop vs under‑sink vs whole‑house**.
- **Flow rate & capacity** vs maintenance frequency.
- **Filter availability & cost**.

## Certifications to Know
- **NSF/ANSI 42** (aesthetics), **53** (health contaminants), **58** (RO), **401** (emerging), **P231** (microbiological).

## Maintenance
- Change filters **on time**.
- Sanitize housings at **every change**.
