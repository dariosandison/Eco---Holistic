Cleaner bedroom air can mean easier mornings and fewer sniffles.

## What to look for
- **True HEPA/H13** (captures fine particles like dust, pollen, smoke).  
- **CADR sized to your room** (bigger rooms need higher CADR).  
- **Low noise** for sleep (check dB at the lowest setting).  
- **Filter cost/availability** you can live with.

## What to avoid
- **Ozone/ionizer modes**—skip in bedrooms.  
- **Tiny units** in big rooms; they won’t keep up.

- Keep doors/windows mostly closed while it’s running.
