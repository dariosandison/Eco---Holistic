A cleaner bedroom isn’t just about tidy sheets. Dust, pet dander, pollen and tiny particles can build up in the air and irritate airways — which can mean snoring, stuffy noses and lighter sleep.

### What to avoid
- **Ozone or “ionizer/ozone” modes**: ozone can be irritating to lungs — skip these entirely.
- **Noisy units**: a purifier that hums past ~30 dB on low can nudge you out of deep sleep.
- **Scented or “deodorizing” gimmicks**: fragrances don’t clean air; they add more things to breathe in.

### What to look for
- **True HEPA (H13/H14)** for fine particles (dust, smoke, pollen).  
- **Activated carbon** if you need odor / VOC reduction (paint, cooking smells).  
- **Proper room sizing**. Check **CADR** and choose a unit rated for at least your bedroom’s size.  
- **Sealed filters + easy replacements** so performance doesn’t drop over time.  
- **Quiet / night mode** with dimmable lights.  
- **Energy efficiency** if it will run overnight, every night.

### Simple sizing rule of thumb
If your room is ~10–15 m², most compact purifiers on **Low–Medium** can keep up. Larger rooms (20–30 m²) usually need a mid-size unit or a compact unit on **Medium–High**.

### Use it well
- Run it **continuously on Low**; bump to **Medium** when you’re cleaning, sharing the space, or pollen is high.
- Place it **away from walls/corners** (15–30 cm clearance) so air can circulate.
- Replace filters on schedule; a clogged filter = weak performance.
