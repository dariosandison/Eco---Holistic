## Targets
- **40–55% RH** indoors; below ~35% = dry skin/throat, above ~60% = mould risk.

## Tools
- A simple **hygrometer** in bedroom and living area.
- Optional: small **humidifier** if RH very low for days.

## Do this first
- Seal drafts; warm air holds moisture better.  
- Vent bathrooms/kitchen longer (15–20 min).  
- Dry clothes with door closed + window ajar or dehumidifier.

## Using a humidifier
- Distilled water if possible; empty nightly; clean weekly with vinegar.  
- Keep away from walls/furniture; aim to the centre of the room.

## Condensation fixes
- Keep furniture slightly off external walls.  
- Wipe and dry window sills daily in cold snaps.

## FAQ
**Plants help?** A little, but not enough—use the basics above.
