    ## Winter Humidity Guide

    Winter Humidity Guide doesn’t have to be complicated. Below we explain what really matters, how to avoid common mistakes, and how to choose options that fit your budget and home.

### Why this matters
Good choices here affect health, comfort, and waste. The wrong pick costs more over time or simply goes unused. We focus on the few specs and habits that deliver outsized results.

**Key spec:** match room size and target humidity/filtration rate. For purifiers, size by CADR and aim for quiet modes you can live with. For humidity, target ~40–50% RH; investigate if you’re consistently above ~60%.

**Common mistakes:** undersizing devices, placing them in corners, forgetting filter changes, or trying to fix moisture with a purifier instead of ventilation/dehumidification.

### How to choose
- **Define the job**: room size, frequency of use, who’s using it.
- **Prioritise the spec that actually changes outcomes** (we call that out below for this category).
- **Total cost over 2–3 years**: filters/refills/consumables and expected lifespan.
- **Noise & ease**: if it’s annoying, people won’t use it.

### Setup & use
Placement, simple routines, and basic maintenance usually move the needle more than chasing premium models. We include quick-start checklists so you get results on day one.

### Maintenance & lifespan
Set calendar reminders for filter changes or parts that wear. Clean monthly, review quarterly, replace annually (as appropriate for the category).

### FAQ
**Do I need the most expensive option?** Not usually—matching the size/spec to your situation matters more.

**What about ‘natural’ vs ‘synthetic’?** Safety depends on the context and concentration, not just the label.

### How we research (no freebies required)
We don’t buy or lab‑test products. Instead we compile manufacturer specs, independent lab tests from reputable outlets, standards and agency guidance, and verified owner feedback. Where data is unclear, we explain the trade‑offs so you can decide with eyes open.

    ## Quick-start checklist
    - Make one change that reduces waste/exposure this week.
    - Set a 3‑month reminder for maintenance or refills.
    - Track what you actually use; donate or recycle the rest.

    ### Original quick notes
    (The original bullets from this post appear below for reference.)

## Targets
- **40–55% RH** indoors; below ~35% = dry skin/throat, above ~60% = mould risk.

## Tools
- A simple **hygrometer** in bedroom and living area.
- Optional: small **humidifier** if RH very low for days.

## Do this first
- Seal drafts; warm air holds moisture better.  
- Vent bathrooms/kitchen longer (15–20 min).  
- Dry clothes with door closed + window ajar or dehumidifier.

## Using a humidifier
- Distilled water if possible; empty nightly; clean weekly with vinegar.  
- Keep away from walls/furniture; aim to the centre of the room.

## Condensation fixes
- Keep furniture slightly off external walls.  
- Wipe and dry window sills daily in cold snaps.

## FAQ
**Plants help?** A little, but not enough—use the basics above.
