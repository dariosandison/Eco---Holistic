## Why these work
Blue and green wavelengths suppress melatonin. Our picks reduce <em>short-wavelength</em> light enough to help you feel sleepy while keeping color fidelity usable for normal evening tasks.

## How we test
- Measured spectra with pocket spectrometer at 400–520 nm bands  
- Tracked bedtime and sleep latency over 14 nights  
- Comfort + adherence scoring

## Alternatives
- Need daytime computer comfort? See **[Breathwork Starter Kit](/guides/breathwork-starter-kit)** to pair wind-down with screen tools.
- Sensitive to dust? Combine with **[Bedroom Air Purifiers](/guides/bedroom-air-purifiers)** for fewer nighttime irritants.

## FAQs
**Do I need dark red lenses?** Not unless you’re extremely sensitive. Amber is enough for most people.
