> **TL;DR:** Replace disposables in order of cost-per-use: safety razor, refillable soap, concentrated cleaner, and a durable toothbrush handle.

## Start with the highest savings

- **Safety razor** — blades cost pennies and give a closer shave.

- **Hand + body soap refills** — keep a pump, refill from a bulk container.

- **All-purpose concentrate** — one bottle, multiple uses.

## Optional upgrades

- Recycled or bamboo **toilet paper**  
- **Shampoo bar** if your water isn’t too hard

## Keep it realistic

Pick one swap per month. Track the saving versus what you used before.
