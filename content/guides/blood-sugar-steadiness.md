faq:
  - q: "Do I have to cut carbs?"
    a: "No. Focus on **fibre + protein + portion sense**. Choose minimally processed carbs (oats, beans, whole grains, potatoes/rice cooled and reheated) and balance your plate."
  - q: "Best meal order?"
    a: "Try **veg first**, then **protein/fat**, then **carbs**—a simple tweak many people find helpful."
  - q: "Walking after meals—how much?"
    a: "**10 minutes** of easy walking (or light cycling/stepping) within 30–60 minutes after eating can help."
  - q: "Snacks?"
    a: "Pair **protein + fibre** (e.g., Greek yogurt + berries, apple + peanut butter, hummus + carrots)."
  - q: "Do I need a glucose monitor?"
    a: "Not necessary for most people. Focus on habits; monitor only with clinical guidance."

Steady energy comes from **simple routines**, not strict rules.

## 1) Build a steadier plate
- **Half plate colourful veg** (raw/cooked).
- **Palm-sized protein** (eggs, fish, beans, tofu, chicken).
- **Fist-sized carbs** (oats, whole-grain bread, potatoes, rice, beans).
- **Thumb of healthy fats** (olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado).

## 2) Eat order & pace
- **Veg → protein/fat → carbs** can blunt sharp spikes.
- Slow down a notch; sip water/tea during the meal.

## 3) Move a little after eating
- **10 minutes** of gentle movement within an hour of meals (walk, tidy up, mini stepper). It all counts.

## 4) Breakfast & snack ideas
- **Oats + chia + Greek yogurt + berries**
- **Eggs + spinach + whole-grain toast**
- **Overnight oats** with nut butter and seeds
- Snacks: **yogurt + berries**, **apple + nuts**, **hummus + veg sticks**.

## 5) Smart add-ons (optional)
- **Psyllium husk**: 1 tsp in water **before** carb-heavy meals can boost fibre intake*.
- Keep a **protein shaker** handy for light meals.
- **Prep lunches** in glass/steel boxes so balance is automatic.

## 6) Sleep & stress matter too
- Aim for **regular sleep** and some **daily unwinding** (walks, stretching, breathwork). Both influence appetite and cravings.

## Our simple kit
- **Psyllium husk**, **protein shaker**, **kitchen scale (short term)**, **glass/steel meal-prep boxes**, and optionally a **walking pad/mini stepper** to make post-meal movement easy.
