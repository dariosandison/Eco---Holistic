## The tiny kit
- **All‑purpose spray:** water + drop mild detergent + a little alcohol.  
- **Glass/mirror:** vinegar + water.  
- **Powder scrub:** bicarb + a pinch of salt.  
- **Microfibre cloths:** 2–3; colour‑code by room.

## Where it shines
- Kitchens, bathrooms (not natural stone), glass, appliances, inside fridge.

## What to skip
- Mixing vinegar with bleach (never), over‑fragranced products, mystery “antibacterial” claims.

## Weekly loop
- 15 min kitchen reset, 15 min bath reset, vacuum + damp dust. Put it on the calendar.

## FAQ
**Will this disinfect?** Cleaning well first removes most germs. Use a dedicated disinfectant only when needed.
