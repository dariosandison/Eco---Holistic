Perfection isn’t the goal — **steady, low‑effort habits are**. This guide focuses on the few moves that cut the most exposure and clutter while keeping your routine simple.

### Start here (first 90 days)
1. **Tackle daily touchpoints:** Upgrade the one thing you handle most (e.g., cookware, storage, cleanser).
2. **Create a “no‑overwhelm” rule:** One swap per month; set a reminder to revisit after 30 days.
3. **Make maintenance obvious:** Keep refills and filters where you’ll see them so the habit sticks.

> **Why it matters**  
> Heat and time increase leaching and breakdown. Moving plastics away from heat and choosing durable materials reduces exposure without changing your recipes or routines.

> **TL;DR:** Get a concentrate, microfibre cloths, glass cleaner, a scrub brush, and washing-up liquid. Refill, don’t rebuy bottles.

## The kit

- **All-purpose concentrate** + reusable bottle
- **Glass cleaner** (alcohol + water base)
- **Microfibre cloths** (colour-code by room)
- **Scrub brush** for grout & pans
- **Dish soap**

## Optional add-ons

- **Descaler** for hard water
- **Oxygen bleach** for laundry & grout

## FAQ
**Is stainless, glass, or cast iron always better?**  
They’re durable and inert for most uses. Pick based on how you cook and clean.

**What if budget is tight?**  
Replace worn items first. Borrow, buy used, or upgrade one staple at a time.
