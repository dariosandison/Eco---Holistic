Blue light in the evening tells your brain it’s daytime. That can delay melatonin and make it harder to fall (and stay) asleep. You don’t need to live by candlelight — just trim the glare.

### What to avoid at night
- **Overhead bright white lights** (cool/“daylight” bulbs).  
- **Face-near screens** (phone, tablet) in the last 60–90 minutes before bed.  
- **Auto-playing bright TV menus** left paused in a dark room.

### What to use instead
- **Warm bulbs (1800–2200K)** for lamps and bedside lights.  
- **Blue-light-reduction on devices** (Night Shift, Night Light, f.lux) set to **stronger** and **earlier**.  
- **Dark mode + lower brightness** after sunset.  
- **Amber/red night lights** for bathrooms or baby checks.

### Optional: blue-blocking glasses
They’re handy if you *must* use screens late, but they don’t fix caffeine, stress or notifications. Think of them as a seatbelt, not a forcefield.

### A few easy picks
- **Warm (amber) LED bulbs for lamps**

### Bedtime routine that works
1. Switch main lights to warm **90 minutes** before bed.  
2. Set screens to **max warm + low brightness**.  
3. Last 30 minutes: no scrolling; stretch, read paper pages, or journal.  
4. Keep the room **dark, cool, quiet**.
