Not all filters fix the same problems. This guide shows **which technology fits which contaminant**, so you don’t overbuy (or under-filter).

## First: what might be in your water?
- **Chlorine taste/smell?** Common in municipal water for disinfection.
- **White crust on taps/kettle?** That’s **limescale (hardness)** — calcium/magnesium.
- **Old plumbing / lead solder?** Consider **lead** reduction.
- **“Chemical” aftertaste or musty odour?** Often **chlorine by-products** or **organics**.
- **Private well / boil notices?** You may need **microbe** protection (bacteria/viruses).
- **Curious about “forever chemicals”?** That’s **PFAS** (emerging contaminants).

## Quick chooser (needs → best tech)

| Your main need | Works best | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Taste/odour, chlorine** | **Activated Carbon** (prefer **carbon block**) | Look for **NSF/ANSI 42** certification. |
| **Lead** | **Carbon block** or **RO** | Seek **NSF/ANSI 53** for lead reduction. |
| **PFAS** | **RO** or premium **carbon block** | Look for lab data/NSF 53/401 claims for PFAS where available. |
| **Nitrates/Fluoride/Arsenic** | **Reverse Osmosis (RO)** | RO handles **dissolved** contaminants best. |
| **Microbes (boil notices/wells)** | **UV**, **RO**, or **ceramic** + carbon | UV inactivates microbes; ceramic filters cysts/bacteria. |
| **Limescale (hard water)** | **Ion-exchange softener** (whole-house) | For taste, carbon helps; to **prevent scale**, use softener/conditioner. |
| **Shower chlorine/odour** | **KDF + Carbon shower filter** | Good for hair/skin; not for drinking water purification. |

> **Certifications matter.** **NSF/ANSI 42** (aesthetics), **53** (health contaminants like lead), **58** (RO systems), **401** (emerging contaminants). Check the exact model’s datasheet.

## Filter types, simply explained

### Activated Carbon (granular vs **carbon block**)
- **Great for:** Chlorine taste/odour, many organics, some pesticides; certain blocks also reduce **lead**, **PFAS**, **cysts**.
- **Look for:** **Carbon block** (denser, better contact time) and **NSF 42/53/401** as needed.
- **Formats:** Jugs, faucet mounts, under-sink cartridges, fridge filters.

### Reverse Osmosis (RO)
- **Great for:** **Dissolved** contaminants (nitrates, fluoride, arsenic), plus many **PFAS** and heavy metals.
- **Notes:** Wastes some water (improving on modern units), usually adds a small tank; water can taste “flat” — consider **remineralising**.
- **Certification:** **NSF/ANSI 58**.

### Ion Exchange / Water Softeners
- **Great for:** Whole-house **scale** reduction (protects pipes/appliances).
- **Notes:** Not a drinking-water purifier; often paired with **carbon** at the kitchen tap.

### UV Disinfection
- **Great for:** **Microbes** (bacteria, viruses, protozoa).
- **Notes:** Use **after sediment filtration** for clarity; does not remove chemicals/metals.

### Ceramic
- **Great for:** **Bacteria/cysts**; often combined with carbon inside.
- **Notes:** Slower flow, manual cleaning.

### Distillation
- **Great for:** Very broad removal via evaporation/condensation.
- **Notes:** **Energy-heavy** and slow; very low mineral taste.

### Shower Filters (KDF + Carbon)
- **Great for:** Reducing **chlorine** and odours at the showerhead.
- **Notes:** Replace on time; not for drinking water safety.

## Which format should I buy?

### Easy & affordable (good start)
- **Jug / pitcher** with **carbon**: quick win for taste and chlorine.  
  Search 👉 <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=water+filter+jug+NSF+53&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

### Kitchen tap upgrades (set-and-forget)
- **Faucet-mount carbon**: installs without tools, moderate flow.  
  Search 👉 <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=faucet+water+filter+carbon+block&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- **Under-sink carbon block**: best taste/odour + lead options; neat faucet or in-line.  
  Search 👉 <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=under+sink+carbon+block+NSF+53&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

### Maximum reduction
- **RO system** (often 4–5 stages): broadest coverage.  
  Search 👉 <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=reverse+osmosis+system+uk&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- **RO + remineralisation**: improves taste/alkalinity.  
  Search 👉 <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=ro+remineralisation+filter&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

### Whole-home comfort
- **Sediment + whole-house carbon** (for chlorine/odour).  
  Search 👉 <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=whole+house+carbon+filter+10+inch&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- **Softener** (for limescale).  
  Search 👉 <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=water+softener+system&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

### Shower & bath
- **Shower filter (KDF + carbon)**: hair/skin comfort.  
  Search 👉 <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=shower+filter+chlorine&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

## Maintenance rules that actually matter
- **Replace on time.** Overused carbon becomes saturated (taste/odour returns).
- **Pre-flush** new cartridges as directed to clear carbon fines.
- **Sanitise** housings during changes (under-sink/whole-house).
- **Don’t rely on TDS alone.** Low TDS ≠ safe; high TDS ≠ unsafe. Use:
  - **Chlorine test strips** to check carbon is still working.  
    👉 <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=free+chlorine+test+strips&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
  - For **RO**: track **% rejection** (input vs output TDS) to know when to change membranes.

---

## Eco & taste tips
- Choose **long-life cartridges** and recycle elements where available.
- For RO, **remineralise** or splash in a mineral pinch for flavour.
- If you only need **taste improvement**, a **good carbon block** is usually enough.

## FAQs

**Do I need RO if my water just tastes like a swimming pool?**  
Probably not. A **carbon block** with **NSF 42** for chlorine/odour usually solves it.

**Will a jug filter remove lead or PFAS?**  
Some **advanced carbon blocks** do, many **don’t**. Look for **NSF 53** (lead) and **401** (emerging contaminants) on the **exact** model.

**Hard water ruined my kettle. What helps?**  
A **softener** stops scale throughout the home. For drinking taste alone, carbon is fine, but it won’t prevent scale in appliances.

**On a private well — what should I pick?**  
Start with a **water test** (microbes, nitrates, hardness, metals). A common stack is **sediment → carbon → UV**; add **RO** if dissolved contaminants are high.
