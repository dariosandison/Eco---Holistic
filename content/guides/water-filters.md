Cleaner water doesn’t have to be complicated. Below are straightforward options that balance **effectiveness, maintenance, and cost**.

## What matters (quickly)
- **Independent testing/standards**: Look for **NSF/ANSI** claims (e.g., 42 taste/odor, 53 lead/organics, 58 RO).
- **Filter life & cost**: Cheaper systems with short filter life often cost more over a year.
- **Fit**: Pitcher vs. faucet vs. under-sink depends on kitchen layout and usage.

---

## 1) Best easy start: **Pitcher or Dispenser**
- Improves taste/odor (NSF/ANSI 42) and, on better models, **reduces lead & PFAS** (NSF/ANSI 53).
- Low install effort; keep in the fridge, swap cartridges as scheduled.

**Look for (UK Amazon searches):**
- [NSF 53 lead-reducing pitcher](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=lead+reducing+water+filter+pitcher+NSF+53&tag=wildandwell0c-21)
- [PFAS-reducing pitcher](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=PFAS+reducing+water+filter+pitcher&tag=wildandwell0c-21)

**Good if:** renters, small households, quick setup.

---

## 2) Best overall filtration: **Under-sink RO (Reverse Osmosis)**
- Multi-stage, often **NSF/ANSI 58**; strong reduction of **TDS, heavy metals, nitrates, PFAS**.
- Needs a dedicated faucet; wastes some water but best broad reduction.

**Look for:**
- [Compact RO system (tankless)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=tankless+reverse+osmosis+system+NSF+58&tag=wildandwell0c-21)
- [Standard RO with remineralisation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=reverse+osmosis+remineralisation+NSF+58&tag=wildandwell0c-21)

**Good if:** you want maximum improvement and can install under the sink.

---

## 3) Low-effort upgrade: **Faucet-mounted filter**
- Snaps onto most taps; quick switch between filtered/unfiltered.
- Check flow rate and cartridge availability.

**Look for:**
- [NSF 42/53 faucet filter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=faucet+mounted+water+filter+NSF+53&tag=wildandwell0c-21)

**Good if:** you want something between a pitcher and RO with easy install.

---

## 4) Bonus: **Shower filter** (for feel, not drinking)
- Aims to reduce **chlorine** and some byproducts; nicer on skin/hair.
- Replace cartridges on time for effect.

**Look for:**
- [Vitamin C / KDF shower filter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=vitamin+C+KDF+shower+filter&tag=wildandwell0c-21)

---

## Maintenance checklist
- **Set reminders** to change cartridges (calendar or label the install date on the filter).
- If water tastes off or flow slows, **change sooner**.
- For RO, **sanitize annually** and replace each stage per maker guidance.

---

## Quick answers
**Will RO remove minerals I want?**  
Yes; many systems add a **remineralisation** stage for taste/alkalinity.

**Do I need a water test first?**  
If budget allows, yes—especially for older plumbing (lead risk) or private wells. Otherwise, choose a filter with **NSF/ANSI** certifications covering your likely concerns.
