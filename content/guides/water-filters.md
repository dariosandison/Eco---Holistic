## Why it matters
Taste/odor reduction ≠ contaminant reduction. Choose based on what’s actually in your water and verified performance.

## What to avoid — and why
- **Vague claims:** “Purifies 99.9% impurities” with no lab data → meaningless.  
- **Only NSF 42:** handles taste/odor; doesn’t imply lead/PFAS reduction.  
- **No published test report:** you can’t compare effectiveness or filter life.  
- **Tiny, pricey cartridges:** great margins, poor capacity → high cost per litre.

## What to look for — and why
- **Certification or independent lab tests** you can read.  
  - **NSF/ANSI 53**: lead, VOCs, cysts (health claims).  
  - **NSF/ANSI 401**: newer/emerging compounds.  
  - **NSF/ANSI 58**: reverse-osmosis systems.  
- **Fit your use:**  
  - **RO under-sink** → broad reduction; best when TDS is high.  
  - **Carbon block (jug/under-sink)** → simpler, cheaper upkeep.  
  - **Gravity stainless** → no power, big capacity.

## Quick picks (UK Amazon)
*(Look for certifications or posted lab data on each product page.)*
- **RO under-sink kits (NSF/58):**

- **Carbon block jugs with 53/401 claims:**

- **Under-sink carbon systems:**

- **Gravity stainless kits:**

## Cost per litre (don’t skip)
Divide **replacement-filter price** by **rated litres**. If you drink ~2 L/person/day, pick something with a sane yearly cost.

### Bottom line
Check your local water report, match the tech, and verify with real test data.
