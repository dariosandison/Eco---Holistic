## Why Water Filters (incl. Fluoride): Simple Choices That Actually Help matters
Water Filters (incl. Fluoride): Simple Choices That Actually Help can play a role in a whole-person approach to wellbeing when paired with foundational habits like sleep, movement, and stress management. Below is a simple, practical guide you can adapt to your lifestyle.

Clean water should taste good and make you want to drink it. Here’s the easy way to choose.

## What to avoid (and why)
- **Vague claims with no test data** – “removes everything!” usually means “proves nothing.”
- **Gimmicks** (magnets, “energy stones”) – don’t reliably reduce contaminants.
- **All-plastic reservoirs that hold odour** – stainless or glass stays fresher.

## Good, simple choices
- **Carbon jug** – improves taste/odour (chlorine), some by-products and micro-impurities.
- **Under-sink carbon** – neater install, better flow, larger capacity.
- **Reverse osmosis (RO)** – broadest reduction across many contaminants **and** reduces fluoride. Add a remineralisation cartridge if you prefer a “spring-like” taste.
- **Shower filter** – targets chlorine/chloramines; many people notice happier skin/hair.

### Fluoride: do you need to remove it?
It’s optional and context-dependent. If you want **fluoride reduced**, look for **RO systems** or cartridges specifically tested for fluoride reduction (check the product’s data sheet).

## Quick picks
- Carbon Jug → https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=nsf+certified+water+filter+jug&tag=wildandwell0c-21
- Under-Sink Carbon → https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=under+sink+water+filter+system&tag=wildandwell0c-21
- RO (incl. fluoride) → https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=reverse+osmosis+system+fluoride&tag=wildandwell0c-21
- Remineralisation Cartridge → https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=remineralization+filter+cartridge&tag=wildandwell0c-21
- Shower Filter (Vit-C/KDF) → https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=vitamin+c+shower+filter&tag=wildandwell0c-21

## How to choose fast
1) **Goal**: taste only → jug; widest coverage/fluoride → RO.
2) **Space**: renting → jug/countertop; homeowners → under-sink/RO.
3) **Upkeep**: check cartridge prices and change schedule before buying.

## Care basics
- Replace cartridges on time (set a phone reminder).
- Clean reservoirs and kettles to prevent biofilm.
- For RO, consider remineralising for taste and to protect coffee equipment.
