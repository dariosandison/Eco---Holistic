avoid:
  - Jugs that only claim “improved taste” if you specifically want fluoride reduction.
  - Vague marketing with no test data or standards listed.
  - High ongoing cartridge costs that make you stop using the filter.
lookfor:
  - Clear statements about what the filter targets.
  - Certifications (NSF/WRAS) or published test data where possible.
  - If fluoride reduction matters to you: reverse osmosis or filters using activated alumina designed for fluoride.

    badge: Broad reduction (incl. fluoride)
    why: RO pushes water through a fine membrane, reducing a wide range of contaminants and can lower fluoride.
    pros: ["Great taste", "Broad reduction", "Good for tea/coffee"]
    cons: ["Needs space", "Sends some water to drain"]
  - title: Countertop Gravity Filter

    href: https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=countertop+gravity+water+filter&tag=wildandwell0c-21
    badge: No plumbing
    why: Simple setup; some models offer specialty cartridges (check if a fluoride cartridge is available).
    pros: ["Easy install", "Great for renters"]
    cons: ["Slower flow", "Cartridges vary by model"]

    badge: Budget start
    why: A jug is the lowest barrier. Look for cartridges specifically designed to reduce fluoride if that’s your goal.
    pros: ["Low cost", "No install"]
    cons: ["Cartridges changed more often", "Capacity limits"]
faqs:
  - q: Does standard carbon remove fluoride?
    a: Standard carbon is great for taste and chlorine but doesn’t reliably reduce fluoride. For fluoride, look for RO systems or cartridges that use media like activated alumina designed for fluoride.
  - q: Is RO “wasteful”?
    a: RO sends some water to drain during filtering; newer systems are more efficient. Many households prefer RO for the taste and broad reduction.
  - q: Do I need mineral drops after filtering?
    a: Some people like to add a pinch of mineral salts for taste. It’s optional—personal preference.

If you just want better taste and fewer odours, a good jug or countertop unit is enough. If you specifically care about fluoride reduction or broader contaminant reduction, go for reverse osmosis or check that your cartridges are designed for the job. Keep it simple and choose a setup you’ll actually maintain.
