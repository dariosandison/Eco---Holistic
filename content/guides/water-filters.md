Clean water should taste good and make you *want* to drink it. Here’s a plain-English guide.

## What to avoid (and why)
- **Vague claims, no testing:** “Removes everything!” but no lab data → skip.
- **Gimmicks:** Magic stones, magnets, or “vortexes” won’t filter reliably.
- **Cheap resin with silver** (no certification): can underperform and add metals.
- **All-plastic reservoirs** that pick up odour—stainless or glass stays fresher.

## Good, simple choices
- **Carbon jug:** Improves taste/odour (chlorine), some by-products and micro-impurities. Low cost, minimal install.
- **Under-sink carbon:** Higher capacity, cleaner look, better flow.
- **Reverse osmosis (RO):** Deepest reduction across many contaminants and **also reduces fluoride**. Add a remineralisation cartridge if you prefer a “spring-like” taste.
- **Shower filter:** Targets chlorine/chloramines—skin/hair often notice the difference.

## Quick Picks
- Carbon Jug → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=nsf+certified+water+filter+jug&tag=wildandwell0c-21>  
- Under-Sink Carbon → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=under+sink+water+filter+system&tag=wildandwell0c-21>  
- RO (incl. fluoride) → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=reverse+osmosis+system+fluoride&tag=wildandwell0c-21>  
- Remineralisation Cartridge → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=remineralization+filter+cartridge&tag=wildandwell0c-21>  
- Shower Filter (Vitamin C/KDF) → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=vitamin+c+shower+filter&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

## How to choose fast
1) **Goal:** Taste only → jug. Wide coverage or **fluoride** → RO.  
2) **Space:** Renters → jug or countertop gravity; homeowners → under-sink or RO.  
3) **Maintenance:** Check **cartridge price** and change schedule before buying.

## Basics for care
- Replace cartridges **on time** (set a phone reminder).  
- Keep reservoirs and kettles clean to prevent biofilm.  
- If you go RO, consider **remineralising** for taste and to protect coffee kit.

### FAQ
**Do I *need* to remove fluoride?** It’s optional. If you want fluoride reduced, look for **RO** or a cartridge tested for it.  
**Is bottled water better?** Not necessarily; it’s pricier and adds plastic. A home filter is usually more convenient.
