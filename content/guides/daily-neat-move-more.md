faq:
  - q: "What is NEAT?"
    a: "NEAT = Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis — the calories you burn outside of formal exercise (walking, fidgeting, chores, standing). It can vary by hundreds of calories per day."
  - q: "How many steps should I aim for?"
    a: "If you average ~3–5k now, try 6–8k first. Many adults feel great around 7–10k, but any increase is a win. Build gradually so it’s sustainable."
  - q: "Will NEAT replace workouts?"
    a: "No — workouts are still great for fitness, strength, and longevity. NEAT complements them and keeps your daily burn higher between sessions."
  - q: "What if I sit all day?"
    a: "Use micro-breaks (1–3 minutes each hour), a walking pad for calls, and bundle errands into 10–15 minute brisk walks."

You don’t need a new training plan — you need to **sprinkle in more movement** during the day. That’s NEAT: the small stuff that quietly boosts energy use, circulation, and mood. Here’s a practical, no-guilt approach.

## Why NEAT matters (in one minute)

- **Calories that don’t feel like exercise** — Walking to the shop, pacing on calls, tidying for 5 minutes… it all counts.  
- **Mood & focus** — Short strolls can lift energy and sharpen thinking.  
- **Joints & back** — Breaking up long sits reduces stiffness, especially in hips and lower back.  
- **Sustainable** — Small, easy habits are easier to keep than heroic workouts.

> Medical note: If you have pain, dizziness, or any condition that limits activity, check with a professional and choose gentle options.

## A simple weekly plan

**Daily anchors (stack these to existing habits):**
- **Morning:** 5–10 min stroll after coffee or school run.  
- **Work hours:** stand for a few emails, **pace during calls**, 1–3 min movement break each hour.  
- **Evening:** 10–15 min walk after dinner or a mini-clean (dishes, surfaces, laundry).

**Targets:**  
- Steps: pick a number you can hit for 5 days straight, then add **+500** next week.  
- Sitting breaks: aim for **1–3 minutes each hour** (timer cube or phone reminder helps).

2. Stairs over lift for ≤3 floors.

6. One-song tidy sprint.  
7. Walk the dog an extra block.  
8. Take bins out immediately.
