Compost wants balance: **greens (nitrogen)** + **browns (carbon)** + **air** + **a little moisture**.

## Common problems
**Smelly/anaerobic (like ammonia or rot)**  
- Add **dry browns**: shredded cardboard, paper, dry leaves.  
- **Stir/aerate** weekly. Create air pockets with a fork or branch.  
- Keep **moist like a wrung sponge**, not wet.

**Fruit flies**  
- Always **bury food scraps** under browns.  
- Cover surface with **cardboard “lid”** or old sack.  
- Avoid frequent citrus peels in small systems.

**Too wet, sludgy**  
- Stop adding wet scraps. Mix in **sawdust/leaves**.  
- Check for rain ingress; add a lid.

**Too dry, not breaking down**  
- Lightly water; add more greens (coffee grounds, veg trimmings).  
- Chop scraps smaller.

## Winter tips (UK)
- Insulate the bin (old duvet/cardboard around sides).  
- Feed smaller amounts, pre‑mix with browns.  
- Bokashi + worm bins work well indoors/garages.

## What can/can’t go
**Yes:** veg scraps, coffee, tea (paper bags), crushed eggshells, plain paper/card.  
**No:** meat, fish, oily foods, glossy/coloured card, “compostable” plastic in cold home systems.

## When is it ready?
Dark, earthy smell; you can’t recognise original scraps. Sieve if you want a finer finish.

## Minimal routine
- Caddy → bin every 2–3 days.  
- Each time add a **handful of browns**.  
- Stir weekly; top with cardboard.
