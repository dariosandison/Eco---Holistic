    ## Composting Troubleshooting

    Composting Troubleshooting doesn’t have to be complicated. Below we explain what really matters, how to avoid common mistakes, and how to choose options that fit your budget and home.

### Why this matters
Good choices here affect health, comfort, and waste. The wrong pick costs more over time or simply goes unused. We focus on the few specs and habits that deliver outsized results.

**Key spec:** balance greens/browns, moisture like a wrung‑out sponge, airflow, and particle size.

**Common mistakes:** adding too many wet kitchen scraps without carbon, compaction, or neglecting aeration.

### How to choose
- **Define the job**: room size, frequency of use, who’s using it.
- **Prioritise the spec that actually changes outcomes** (we call that out below for this category).
- **Total cost over 2–3 years**: filters/refills/consumables and expected lifespan.
- **Noise & ease**: if it’s annoying, people won’t use it.

### Setup & use
Placement, simple routines, and basic maintenance usually move the needle more than chasing premium models. We include quick-start checklists so you get results on day one.

### Maintenance & lifespan
Set calendar reminders for filter changes or parts that wear. Clean monthly, review quarterly, replace annually (as appropriate for the category).

### FAQ
**Do I need the most expensive option?** Not usually—matching the size/spec to your situation matters more.

**What about ‘natural’ vs ‘synthetic’?** Safety depends on the context and concentration, not just the label.

### How we research (no freebies required)
We don’t buy or lab‑test products. Instead we compile manufacturer specs, independent lab tests from reputable outlets, standards and agency guidance, and verified owner feedback. Where data is unclear, we explain the trade‑offs so you can decide with eyes open.

    ## Quick-start checklist
    - Make one change that reduces waste/exposure this week.
    - Set a 3‑month reminder for maintenance or refills.
    - Track what you actually use; donate or recycle the rest.

    ### Original quick notes
    (The original bullets from this post appear below for reference.)

Compost wants balance: **greens (nitrogen)** + **browns (carbon)** + **air** + **a little moisture**.

## Common problems
**Smelly/anaerobic (like ammonia or rot)**  
- Add **dry browns**: shredded cardboard, paper, dry leaves.  
- **Stir/aerate** weekly. Create air pockets with a fork or branch.  
- Keep **moist like a wrung sponge**, not wet.

**Fruit flies**  
- Always **bury food scraps** under browns.  
- Cover surface with **cardboard “lid”** or old sack.  
- Avoid frequent citrus peels in small systems.

**Too wet, sludgy**  
- Stop adding wet scraps. Mix in **sawdust/leaves**.  
- Check for rain ingress; add a lid.

**Too dry, not breaking down**  
- Lightly water; add more greens (coffee grounds, veg trimmings).  
- Chop scraps smaller.

## Winter tips (UK)
- Insulate the bin (old duvet/cardboard around sides).  
- Feed smaller amounts, pre‑mix with browns.  
- Bokashi + worm bins work well indoors/garages.

## What can/can’t go
**Yes:** veg scraps, coffee, tea (paper bags), crushed eggshells, plain paper/card.  
**No:** meat, fish, oily foods, glossy/coloured card, “compostable” plastic in cold home systems.

## When is it ready?
Dark, earthy smell; you can’t recognise original scraps. Sieve if you want a finer finish.

## Minimal routine
- Caddy → bin every 2–3 days.  
- Each time add a **handful of browns**.  
- Stir weekly; top with cardboard.
