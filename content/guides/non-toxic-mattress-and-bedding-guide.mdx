# Non‑Toxic Mattress & Bedding (UK)

Sleep is recovery—materials matter.

## TL;DR
- Prefer **natural latex**, **wool**, and **organic cotton**.
- Look for **GOLS/GOTS**, **OEKO‑TEX**, or **CertiPUR‑US** (for foam).
- UK fire regs: ask brands how they meet them **without** added flame retardants (e.g., **barrier fabrics**).

## What to Ask a Brand
- Glue type and adhesives, foam type and density.
- FR strategy (barrier vs chemical).
- Cover and zipper materials, country of assembly.

## Bedding
- **Wool duvets** regulate temp, **linen** breathes, **cotton sateen** for softness.
