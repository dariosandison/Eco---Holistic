## Priorities

- Firmness you actually sleep well on
- Breathable natural fibres (cotton, linen, wool)
- Certifications with teeth (look beyond marketing)

### Bedding short list

- Organic cotton sheets (percale for cool sleepers)  
- Wool duvet for humidity control  
- Waterproof **mattress protector** (PU/TPU backing)
