    ## Non‑Toxic Mattress & Bedding Guide

    Non‑Toxic Mattress & Bedding Guide doesn’t have to be complicated. Below we explain what really matters, how to avoid common mistakes, and how to choose options that fit your budget and home.

### Why this matters
Good choices here affect health, comfort, and waste. The wrong pick costs more over time or simply goes unused. We focus on the few specs and habits that deliver outsized results.

**Key spec:** support first, materials second. Look for certifications appropriate to the material (e.g., latex certifications, textile standards).

**Common mistakes:** chasing material claims while ignoring firmness and sleep position.

### How to choose
- **Define the job**: room size, frequency of use, who’s using it.
- **Prioritise the spec that actually changes outcomes** (we call that out below for this category).
- **Total cost over 2–3 years**: filters/refills/consumables and expected lifespan.
- **Noise & ease**: if it’s annoying, people won’t use it.

### Setup & use
Placement, simple routines, and basic maintenance usually move the needle more than chasing premium models. We include quick-start checklists so you get results on day one.

### Maintenance & lifespan
Set calendar reminders for filter changes or parts that wear. Clean monthly, review quarterly, replace annually (as appropriate for the category).

### FAQ
**Do I need the most expensive option?** Not usually—matching the size/spec to your situation matters more.

**What about ‘natural’ vs ‘synthetic’?** Safety depends on the context and concentration, not just the label.

### How we research (no freebies required)
We don’t buy or lab‑test products. Instead we compile manufacturer specs, independent lab tests from reputable outlets, standards and agency guidance, and verified owner feedback. Where data is unclear, we explain the trade‑offs so you can decide with eyes open.

    ## Quick-start checklist
    - Make one change that reduces waste/exposure this week.
    - Set a 3‑month reminder for maintenance or refills.
    - Track what you actually use; donate or recycle the rest.

    ### Original quick notes
    (The original bullets from this post appear below for reference.)

## Materials 101
- **Natural latex + wool + cotton:** breathable, durable; higher upfront cost, long life.  
- **Polyfoam/memory foam:** affordable; look for **CertiPUR‑US** or **OEKO‑TEX**.  
- **Springs + natural top layers** can balance budget and breathability.

## Certifications to know
- **GOTS** (textiles), **GOLS** (latex), **OEKO‑TEX Standard 100**, **FSC** (wood), **CertiPUR‑US** (foam).

## Picking your mattress
- Side sleepers: softer top (pressure relief). Back/stomach: medium‑firm.  
- Hot sleepers: coil + latex or breathable cover.  
- Allergies: zipped, washable encasement; vacuum mattress top monthly.

## Bedding priorities
- 100% cotton or linen sheets; wash weekly at 40–60 °C.  
- Wool or cotton duvets for moisture control; avoid heavy fragranced softeners.

## Budget moves
- Upgrade **pillows** and **encasement** first; they affect airways most.

## FAQ
**Do I need all‑natural?** Not always. Focus on breathable covers and credible certifications.
