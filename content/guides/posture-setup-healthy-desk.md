lookfor:
  - Screen top at (or just below) eye level.

## Why it matters
Good setup = **less strain, more focus**. You don’t need a brand-new desk — lift the screen, bring input devices to you, and move a little more, more often.

## Quick setup checklist
- Screen top at eye level; arm’s length away.  
- Elbows about 90°, shoulders relaxed; wrists neutral.  
- Hips slightly higher than knees when sitting.  
- Stand for 15–30 min blocks, then sit again — rotate.

## 1-minute micro-moves (set a timer hourly)
- 10 calf raises, 10 shoulder rolls, 5 chest-openers on a doorway.  
- Look far away for 20 seconds (eye strain reset).  
- Sit-to-stand ×5.
