# Daily & weekly moves

- Vent bathrooms for 20 minutes after showers  
- Run a bedroom purifier on low at night — see **[Bedroom Air Purifiers](/guides/bedroom-air-purifiers)**  
- Keep RH 40–50% (a small dehumidifier helps)

## Low-tox cleaning kit
- Microfiber + 3% hydrogen peroxide for spots  
- Soap + water for routine wipe-downs  
- HEPA vacuum on hard floors weekly
