faq:
  - q: "What humidity should I aim for?"
    a: "Around **40–50% RH** most of the time. Below ~60% slows mould growth."
  - q: "Vinegar or hydrogen peroxide?"
    a: "**White vinegar** works well for light surface mildew on non-porous areas; **3% hydrogen peroxide** can be used similarly. Always test a small area and ventilate. Avoid mixing chemicals."
  - q: "Bleach?"
    a: "On **porous** materials it often doesn’t penetrate deeply. Stick to removal/replacement of damaged materials and moisture control. For large growth, seek a professional."
  - q: "When do I call a pro?"
    a: "If the area is **large**, damage is ongoing, there’s a **leak**, or anyone has health symptoms—get qualified help."

A fresh, low-mould home is mostly about **moisture control + simple routines**.

## 1) Control moisture first
- **Ventilate:** open windows (weather allowing); run **extractor fans** during/after showers and cooking (10–20 min).  
- **Dehumidify:** in damp rooms, run a **dehumidifier** to hold **~40–50% RH**.  
- **Fix sources:** leaks, overflows, gutter issues, or bridging against external walls—**address the cause**.

## 2) Daily habits that stack up
- **Bathrooms:** squeegee screens/tiles; hang towels so they fully dry; keep door ajar or fan on.  
- **Kitchens:** pan lids on; extractor on; wipe condensation from windows and sills.  
- **Laundry:** dry **outside** or with vented/condensing dryer; avoid air-drying in small rooms without dehumidification.

## 3) Quick clean for small spots
- On **hard, non-porous** areas (tile, glass, sealed paint):  
  1. Spray **white vinegar** or **3% hydrogen peroxide** (don’t mix).  
  2. Let sit a few minutes, wipe with **microfibre**.  
  3. Dry the area.  
- On **porous** materials (plasterboard, insulation, carpet underlay): removing and replacing may be necessary—seek advice.

## 4) Bedrooms & storage
- Keep furniture slightly **off external walls** for airflow.  
- Use breathable storage (avoid cramming wardrobes).  
- In cold snaps, watch **window condensation** and wipe it off in the morning.
