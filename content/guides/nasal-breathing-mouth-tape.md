Nasal breathing humidifies, warms, and filters air. Some people use **mouth tape** to encourage it—start **cautiously**.

## Important cautions
- Don’t use mouth tape if you have nasal obstruction, untreated sleep apnea, nausea/vomiting risk, or with children. If unsure, talk to a clinician.
- Trial **daytime** first for 10–15 minutes while reading/working to check comfort.

## How to try it
- Use **gentle, hypoallergenic strips** designed for sleep; avoid strong adhesives.
- Place tape vertically in the middle of the lips (space on both sides) or use pre-cut “vented” strips so you can still mouth-breathe if needed.
- Pair with **nasal rinse** or saline spray if stuffy.
