Small changes, repeated daily, reset your sleep faster than any extreme overhaul. Here’s a simple, low-effort routine that works even on busy weeks.

## Morning (anchor your clock)
- **Light within 30–60 minutes of waking.** Get outside if possible (even cloudy light helps).
- **Hydrate before caffeine.** A big glass of water first, coffee/tea next.
- **Move a little.** 5–10 minutes of walking or light mobility is plenty.

## Afternoon (protect the evening)
- **Caffeine cut-off ~8h before bed.** Saves you from wired-but-tired nights.
- **Keep naps short** (10–20 minutes) and before 3pm.

## Evening (wind down, don’t power down)
- **Dim screens/lights 60–90 min before bed.** Clip-on blue-blockers help if you must screen.
- **Warm shower → cool room.** The temperature drop nudges sleepiness.
- **Repeatable ritual:** stretch, journal, chamomile tea – same order nightly.

## Bedroom quick wins
- **Dark:** blackout curtains or an eye mask.
- **Cool:** crack a window or lower the thermostat a notch.
- **Quiet:** earplugs or a simple white-noise app.

## Our picks
- **Sunrise alarm clock** for softer wake-ups.
- **Blackout curtains** to keep light out.
- **Blue-light clip-ons** for late laptop sessions.
- **Magnesium glycinate*** if it fits your routine.
