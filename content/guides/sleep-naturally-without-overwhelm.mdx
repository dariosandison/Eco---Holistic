If you’re tired of “sleep hacks”, this guide is for you. We’ll keep it simple: **comfort + consistency + the basics**. Then, only if you want, we’ll add gentle extras.

> **Quick start:** pick **one** upgrade from the list below and do it for **7 nights**. Don’t change everything at once.

## The 80/20 sleep checklist
1. **Same wake time** (even weekends, within 60–90 minutes)
2. **Morning light** (10–20 minutes outdoors if possible)
3. **Bedroom temperature**: cooler than you think (aim “cool + cosy”)
4. **Caffeine cut-off**: 8–10 hours before bed
5. **Wind-down**: 20–30 minutes, same order, same time

## Fix these in order
### 1) Light (the sleep “clock”)
- Bright light in the morning helps shift your rhythm earlier.
- Dimmer light in the evening helps your brain get the “night” signal.

**Try tonight:** lower overhead lights after dinner + use a lamp.

### 2) Temperature & bedding comfort
Most people sleep better when the room is cooler and bedding is breathable.

**Try tonight:** crack a window + lighter duvet + a warm sock if your feet get cold.

### 3) Caffeine & timing
If you “sleep but don’t feel rested”, caffeine timing is a common culprit.

**Try this week:** move caffeine earlier by 60–90 minutes.

### 4) Noise & air quality
If your room feels stuffy or you wake congested, air quality can matter more than you think.

## Gentle natural supports (optional)
These are optional — start with the basics above.

### Magnesium (common starting point)
Many people prefer **magnesium glycinate** for evening use. Start low, assess tolerance, and don’t stack lots of supplements.

### Herbal teas
Chamomile or lemon balm are gentle options.

### Simple breath routine
4–6 slow breaths per minute for 3–5 minutes can reduce “wired” feelings.

## What to avoid (common traps)
- Switching five things at once
- Mega-dose supplements
- “Detox” claims
- Over-tracking (sleep apps can backfire for anxious sleepers)
