## Why start here
Small, consistent changes beat total overhauls. These five swaps lower routine exposures and improve sleep/energy without turning your life upside down.

---

## 1) Better drinking water
**Avoid & why:** vague “removes impurities” claims; filters that only reduce taste/odor (NSF 42) but not common contaminants (e.g., chlorine by-products, lead).  
**Look for & why:** actual certification or test data. **NSF/ANSI 53** (lead/organics), **401** (emerging compounds). Reverse osmosis (RO) = broad reduction; jug or under-sink carbon = simpler.

**Quick picks (UK Amazon):**
- RO under-sink kits (look for NSF/ANSI 58):

- Jug filters with 53/401 claims:

## 2) Cleaner indoor air (easy mode)
**Avoid & why:** heavy use of sprays, strong fragrances, scented candles—raise VOCs/particles.  
**Look for & why:** HEPA (H13) purifiers sized for your room; fragrance-free habits; regular airing.

**Quick picks:**
- Room HEPA air purifiers (H13 or “True HEPA”):  
  <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=hepa+air+purifier+h13&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- Unscented cleaning basics (see cleaning guide):

## 3) Evening light hygiene
**Avoid & why:** bright blue-heavy light after sunset → suppresses melatonin, poorer sleep.  
**Look for & why:** warmer lamps at night, device night modes, optional blue-light glasses.

**Quick picks:**
- Warm LED bulbs (2700K or “warm white”):  
  <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=warm+white+led+bulb+2700k&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- Blue-light filter glasses:  
  <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=blue+light+blocking+glasses&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

---

## 4) Sleep environment basics
**Avoid & why:** late caffeine/alcohol, hot bedrooms, light leaks.  
**Look for & why:** 16–19 °C room temp, blackout curtains or a sleep mask, consistent schedule.

**Quick picks:**
- Blackout curtains:  
  <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=blackout+curtains&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- Breathable cotton bedding:

## 5) Low-waste body care
**Avoid & why:** microplastics in scrubs, strong synthetic fragrance, harsh sulfates if you’re sensitive.  
**Look for & why:** short ingredient lists, bar formats, refill pouches, fragrance-free options.

**Quick picks:**
- Solid shampoo/conditioner bars:  
  <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=shampoo+bar+solid&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- Safety razor + blades:  
  <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=safety+razor+double+edge&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
