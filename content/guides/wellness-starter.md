Want quick, meaningful improvement without overhauling your life? Start here. These small changes create outsized gains in how you feel day-to-day.

## 1) Water you enjoy drinking
- **Why it matters:** Better taste → you drink more; basic filtration can reduce chlorine by-products and some micro-impurities.
- **Easy options:** A **carbon jug** or **under-sink carbon** system. For the deepest removal (incl. **fluoride**), **reverse osmosis (RO)**.

**Quick Picks**
- Carbon Jug → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=water+filter+jug+nsf+certified&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- Under-Sink Carbon → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=under+sink+water+filter+nsf&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- RO System → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=reverse+osmosis+system+uk&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

## 2) Sleep that resets you
- **Why:** Light and temperature nudge your body clock.
- **Do now:** Dim screens 2 hours before bed; keep the room **cool, dark, and quiet**.

**Quick Picks**
- Blackout Curtains → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=blackout+curtains+bedroom&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- Warm 2200K Bulbs → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=2200k+led+bulb+e27&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- Eye Mask (comfy) → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=silk+sleep+mask&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

## 3) Air that’s easier to breathe
- **Why:** Indoors ≠ always cleaner. A compact **HEPA H13** purifier captures fine particles and pollen.
- **Note:** Avoid **ozone/ionizer** modes in bedrooms.

**Quick Picks**
- Bedroom HEPA H13 → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=hepa+h13+air+purifier+bedroom&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

## 4) Gentle, low-waste basics
- **Why:** Fewer harsh fragrances/solvents = calmer skin and sinuses.
- **Swap:** Concentrated **castile soap**, **microfiber cloths**, **fragrance-free laundry**.

**Quick Picks**
- Castile Soap → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=castile+soap+unscented&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- Microfiber Cloths → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=microfiber+cleaning+cloths&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- Fragrance-Free Laundry → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=fragrance+free+laundry+detergent&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

## 5) Simple, consistent movement
- **Why:** 10–20 minutes daily beats a long workout once a month.
- **Do now:** Walks, mobility, light strength.

**Quick Picks**
- Cork Yoga Mat → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=cork+yoga+mat&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
