You don’t need fear—just **clean habits** you can repeat anywhere.

## Daily habits that matter most
- **Hand hygiene:** soap and water where possible; carry **soap sheets/sanitiser** for gaps.  
- **Water sense:** in uncertain areas, use a **filter bottle**, boiled water, or sealed beverages; skip dodgy ice.  
- **Food sense:** eat foods that are **cooked through and served hot.** Use an **instant-read thermometer** when you’re not sure.

## Travel checklist
- Filter bottle • ORS sachets • Soap sheets/sanitiser • Small first-aid kit • Resealable bags (keep clean utensils separate).

## If your stomach flips
- **Hydration first:** **ORS sachets** as directed.  
- **Rest + simple foods** (rice, bananas, broth) as tolerated.  
- **Seek medical care** if symptoms are persistent, severe, bloody, feverish, or you’re in a vulnerable group (kids, pregnancy, older adults).

## Our picks
- A **filter bottle** for uncertain water, a **thermometer** for safe cooking, **ORS**, and **pocket hand hygiene**. Simple, packable, effective.
