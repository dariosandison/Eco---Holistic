## What to avoid — and why
- **Undisclosed “fragrance/parfum”** — can include dozens of chemicals; common irritant.  
- **Mixing bleach + ammonia/acid** — dangerous chloramine/chlorine gas.  
- **Spray overload** — raises indoor VOCs and fine particles.  
- **Quats (e.g., benzalkonium chloride)** — effective disinfectants, but overuse can irritate; reserve for true disinfection needs.

## What to look for — and why
- **Fragrance-free or clearly disclosed scents** → fewer unknowns.  
- **Concentrates/refills** → less plastic, less storage.  
- **Short ingredient lists** (soap, vinegar, alcohol, surfactants you can pronounce).  
- **Microfiber** for mechanical cleaning → often replaces product.

### Routine that works
Ventilate while cleaning, use the smallest effective amount, and keep a single disinfectant for actual illness/food-safety moments.
