You don’t need a cupboard full of strong fragrances to stay clean.

## What to avoid (and why)
- **Heavy synthetic fragrance:** Can irritate airways and linger on fabrics.
- **Quats** (disinfectants) for everyday wiping—they’re for specific germs, not daily dust.
- **Chlorine bleach daily use:** Great for specific sanitising jobs, but not routine wiping.
- **Harsh solvents** on food surfaces—save them for sticky messes only.

## Better everyday choices
- **Concentrated castile soap** for most surfaces.  
- **Microfiber cloths** lift grime with water alone.  
- **Citric acid** or **white vinegar** for limescale (avoid on stone).  
- **Fragrance-free laundry liquid** for skin-friendly clothes and bedding.

## 3 tiny DIYs
- **All-purpose:** 1 tsp castile + 500 ml warm water (shake).  
- **Glass:** 1 part white vinegar + 3 parts water (microfiber wipe).  
- **Limescale:** Sprinkle citric acid on wet surface → wait → rinse.

### FAQ
**Do I need antibacterial spray daily?** Not usually. Clean first; disinfect only when needed (illness, raw meat spills, etc.).  
**Is “eco” always safer?** Labels can mislead—short ingredient lists and clear dilution ratios are your friends.
