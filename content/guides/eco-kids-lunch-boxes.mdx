## Materials that make sense
- **Stainless steel**: tough, long‑lasting, no odour. Use silicone cups for wet items.  
- **PP #5 plastic**: lightweight, affordable; avoid heat + harsh scrubbing.  
- **Silicone**: good for lids and snack pouches; check for firmness and no fillers.

## Leakproof, realistically
- Choose **one leakproof pot** for yoghurt/dips instead of an all‑leakproof box.  
- Pack wet foods upright. Add a small cloth to catch condensation.

## Sizes per age
- **Under 5:** 600–800 ml, 2–3 compartments.  
- **5–9:** 900–1100 ml, 3–4 compartments.  
- **10+ / teens:** 1.2–1.4 L, add a separate snack pot.

## Packing pattern
Protein + veg/fruit + whole grain + healthy fat. Keep repeats to reduce decision fatigue.

## Cleaning & care
- Hand‑wash lids; dishwasher can warp seals.  
- Air‑dry open. Refresh silicone with a bicarb paste if smells linger.

## What to avoid
- Heavily fragranced lunch bags, PVC linings, novelty coatings that peel.

## FAQ
**Steel is heavy—is it worth it?** For daily use and longevity, yes. Pair with a light bottle.
