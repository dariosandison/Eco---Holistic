## What to avoid — and why
- **High added sugar** (aim ≤5 g per 30 g serving) → energy crash.  
- **Vegetable/seed oils** added to cereals → unnecessary calories/oxidation.  
- **Artificial colours/flavours** — skip if you want simpler labels.  
- **Over-fortification** if you already supplement — totals can creep up.

## What to look for — and why
- **Short ingredient lists** (1–5 ingredients).  
- **Whole grains** (oats, wheat, brown rice) for fiber/satiety.  
- **No added oils**; if sweetened, prefer honey or minimal sugar.
