A good rule: **ingredients you recognise** and **less added sugar**.

## What to avoid (and why)
- **Sugar first:** If sugar is the first ingredient, it’s a dessert.
- **Glazes & oils:** Palm/sunflower glaze can add unnecessary calories.
- **Artificial colours/flavours:** Fun colours, little value.

## Better choices
- **Puffed grains** (rice, wheat, corn) with short lists.  
- **Oats** (porridge or overnight) — add fruit/nuts yourself.  
- **Muesli** with whole grains + nuts/seeds and minimal sweeteners.

**Quick Picks**
- “No Added Sugar” Muesli → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=no+added+sugar+muesli&tag=wildandwell0c-21>  
- Organic Rolled Oats → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=organic+rolled+oats&tag=wildandwell0c-21>  
- Rude Health “Honey Puffs” → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=rude+health+honey+puffs&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

### Add flavour without the junk
- Fruit (banana, berries), cinnamon, nuts, plain yoghurt, or a drizzle of honey.
