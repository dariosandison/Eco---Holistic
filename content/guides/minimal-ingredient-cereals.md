## What to *avoid* (fast label scan)
- **Sugar as a top ingredient** and multiple sweeteners (glucose-fructose syrup, invert sugar).
- **Artificial/Intense sweeteners** (sucralose, acesulfame K) if you’re trying to retrain a sweet tooth.
- **Unnecessary oils** (many granolas add sunflower/rapeseed oil in large amounts).
- **Colourings & heavy flavourings** (you won’t miss them).

## What to *look for*
- **Whole grains first** (oats, whole wheat, rye, spelt, buckwheat).
- **5 ingredients or fewer**, all recognisable.
- **<10 g sugar per 100 g** for everyday choices (granola is often higher).
- **High fibre** (aim ~6 g+ per 100 g) and **some protein** (you can add more — see below).

- **Ingredients:** can you **recognise every item**? (Yes = green flag.)
- **Sugar:** ideally **<10 g/100 g** for daily cereals; granola is a treat topper.

- **Allergens/diet:** check for **gluten** (oats can be GF-certified), **nuts**, **seeds**.

## FAQs

**Are “honey puff” cereals okay?**  
Some are just **grain + honey + salt**. They’re sweet, so use smaller portions or mix 50/50 with unsweetened puffs.

**Gluten-free options?**  
Choose **certified gluten-free oats** or **puffed rice/buckwheat** varieties.

**How do I add protein without long labels?**  
Use **plain Greek yoghurt**, **milk**, **soy milk**, or a **clean protein powder** (few ingredients) stirred into oats or yoghurt.

**Storage tips**  
Keep in an **airtight jar** away from heat/light to preserve freshness and crunch.
