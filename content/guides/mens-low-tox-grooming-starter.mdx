## Core routine (5 minutes)
- **Wash:** mild, fragrance‑free body wash or bar.  
- **Shave:** cream/soap with glycerin or aloe; change blades often.  
- **Moisturise:** light lotion with squalane or shea; SPF in daytime.

## After‑shave without sting
- Alcohol‑heavy splashes = irritation. Try a soothing gel (aloe, allantoin).

## Deodorant
- Look for magnesium/zinc salts; patch‑test baking‑soda formulas.

## Hair & scalp
- Alternate gentle shampoo with co‑wash days if hair is dry. Avoid strong fragrance if sensitive.

## Gym bag list
Travel bottle, small bar tin, microfibre towel, roll‑on deo.

## FAQ
**Is fragrance‑free boring?** It’s discreet—and plays nicer with skin and shared spaces.
