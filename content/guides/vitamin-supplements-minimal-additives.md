Supplements should be **simple**. Look for short “other ingredients” and forms your body can use.

## What to avoid (and why)
- **Artificial colours & titanium dioxide:** For looks, not function.
- **Sugar-heavy gummies:** Tasty, but often more candy than nutrient.
- **Proprietary blends** without amounts: you can’t compare doses.

## Better forms (general)
- **Magnesium glycinate** (gentle on the gut).
- **Methyl B12 (methylcobalamin)** and **methylfolate** (active forms).
- **Vitamin D3 (often with K2)** for absorption and balance.

**Quick Picks**
- Magnesium Glycinate (Capsules) → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=magnesium+glycinate+capsules&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- B12 (Methylcobalamin) → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=methylcobalamin+b12&tag=wildandwell0c-21>
- Vitamin D3 + K2 → <https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=vitamin+d3+k2&tag=wildandwell0c-21>

### Tips
- **Capsules** usually need fewer binders than tablets.
- Check serving size vs. dose (some labels are per **2–3 capsules**).
- If you take meds or are pregnant/breastfeeding, **talk to your clinician first**.
