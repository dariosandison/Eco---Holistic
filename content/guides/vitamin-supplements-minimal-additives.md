Short ingredient lists are the goal. When possible, choose powders or simple capsules/softgels without dyes, artificial flavors, or long lists of flow agents. This guide gives you quick label tips and example products that typically keep things simple.

## Quick Label Tips

- **Prefer simple forms**: powders, capsules with cellulose shells, or softgels for oils.  
- **Avoid ‚Äúextras‚Äù** when alternatives exist: artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, titanium dioxide.  
- **Match the format to the nutrient**: oils (e.g., D3/K2, omega-3) are usually softgels; minerals/vitamins often fine as powders or capsules.  
- **Skip ‚Äúproprietary blends‚Äù** when you want exact amounts of each ingredient.

## How to Compare Two Similar Options

1. **Scan the excipients** first (everything after the active ingredient).  
2. **Prefer shorter** excipient lists, avoiding dyes and artificial sweeteners.  
3. **Capsules vs tablets**: capsules often allow simpler formulas.  
4. **Unflavoured when possible**: you can add your own flavour to powders.
