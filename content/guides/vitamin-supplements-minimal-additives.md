## What to avoid — and why
- **Artificial colours/flavours** — unnecessary in capsules.  
- **Titanium dioxide** (colourant) — avoid if you prefer minimal excipients.  
- **Gummy overload** — often more sugar/gelatin, less precise dosing.  
- **Mega-doses** without a reason — more ≠ better.

## What to look for — and why
- **Short excipient lists** (e.g., capsule + rice flour).  
- **Capsule shells** like **HPMC (hypromellose)** or gelatin if you tolerate it.  
- **Third-party testing** (NSF, Informed Choice) or brand transparency.  
- **Forms that suit you** (e.g., **methylcobalamin** B12 if you prefer active forms).
