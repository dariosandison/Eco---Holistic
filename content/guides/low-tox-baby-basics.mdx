> **TL;DR:** Prioritise a firm mattress, breathable bedding, and simple feeding gear. Buy once, buy right.

## Must-haves

- **Firm mattress + fitted sheets**
- **Simple bottles** (if using) with few parts
- **Washable play mat** or blanket

## Nice-to-haves

- **Blackout curtain** for naps
- **White noise** (phone app is fine)

> Always follow local safety guidance and manufacturer instructions.
