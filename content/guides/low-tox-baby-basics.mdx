    ## Low‑Tox Baby Basics

    Low‑Tox Baby Basics doesn’t have to be complicated. Below we explain what really matters, how to avoid common mistakes, and how to choose options that fit your budget and home.

### Why this matters
Good choices here affect health, comfort, and waste. The wrong pick costs more over time or simply goes unused. We focus on the few specs and habits that deliver outsized results.

**Key spec:** safety certifications, easy‑to‑clean surfaces, and fewer parts.

**Common mistakes:** over‑buying gear that’s hard to maintain or clean.

### How to choose
- **Define the job**: room size, frequency of use, who’s using it.
- **Prioritise the spec that actually changes outcomes** (we call that out below for this category).
- **Total cost over 2–3 years**: filters/refills/consumables and expected lifespan.
- **Noise & ease**: if it’s annoying, people won’t use it.

### Setup & use
Placement, simple routines, and basic maintenance usually move the needle more than chasing premium models. We include quick-start checklists so you get results on day one.

### Maintenance & lifespan
Set calendar reminders for filter changes or parts that wear. Clean monthly, review quarterly, replace annually (as appropriate for the category).

### FAQ
**Do I need the most expensive option?** Not usually—matching the size/spec to your situation matters more.

**What about ‘natural’ vs ‘synthetic’?** Safety depends on the context and concentration, not just the label.

### How we research (no freebies required)
We don’t buy or lab‑test products. Instead we compile manufacturer specs, independent lab tests from reputable outlets, standards and agency guidance, and verified owner feedback. Where data is unclear, we explain the trade‑offs so you can decide with eyes open.

    ## Quick-start checklist
    - Make one change that reduces waste/exposure this week.
    - Set a 3‑month reminder for maintenance or refills.
    - Track what you actually use; donate or recycle the rest.

    ### Original quick notes
    (The original bullets from this post appear below for reference.)

## What truly matters
- **Skin‑safe basics:** fragrance‑free wash, plain moisturiser (e.g., shea + glycerin).  
- **Breathable sleep space:** firm mattress, fitted sheet, bare cot.  
- **Air & laundry:** ventilate; use fragrance‑free powder; extra rinse for new textiles.

## Gear list (minimal)
- 2–3 cotton fitted sheets, 4–6 muslins, 2 blankets (cotton/wool).  
- Changing mat + water + cloths; nappy balm with simple ingredients.  
- Car seat per safety rating; second‑hand is fine **only** if history known.

## Bath & skin
- Infrequent bathing is okay. Moisturise damp skin. Patch‑test new products.

## Home environment
- Vacuum with HEPA, damp‑dust weekly.  
- Avoid plug‑in fragrances and strong cleaners.

## Feeding notes
- If using bottles: choose reputable materials (PP, glass), clean thoroughly, air‑dry.

## FAQ
**Do I need “baby‑specific” everything?** No—gentle, simple household products often work well.
