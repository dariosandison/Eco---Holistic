Cold can feel energising—if you respect it. The goal is **calm exposure**, not suffering.

## Safety first
- Avoid cold exposure if you have cardiovascular disease, unmanaged blood pressure issues, Raynaud’s, are pregnant, or feel unwell. When in doubt, talk to your clinician.
- Never do breath-holding in the shower or tub. Don’t train alone.

## Start easy (showers)
- End your normal warm shower with **30–60 sec cool** on legs/arms → **build to 2–3 min** over weeks.
- Breathe **slowly** through the nose; aim to feel calm, not panicked.

## Beyond showers
- **Cold tub/barrel:** Start at ~12–15 °C for **1–3 min**. Increase time or decrease temp gradually.
- **Frequency:** 2–4 sessions/week is plenty.
