# Starter plan (3x/week)
- End showers with 30–60 seconds cool, build to 2–3 minutes  
- Keep evenings warm if sleep suffers; combine with **[Breathwork Starter Kit](/guides/breathwork-starter-kit)**

## Helpful gear
- Kitchen thermometer for bath temps  
- Warm hat/gloves for outdoor dips in winter
