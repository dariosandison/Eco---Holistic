## Choose your method
- **Outdoor bin/tumbler:** garden space, takes most veg scraps.  
- **Worm farm (vermicompost):** flats/indoors; fast, odour‑light.  
- **Bokashi:** ferments all food (even small meat/dairy), then bury or add to compost.

## Core ratios
- Aim for **2–3 parts browns** (cardboard, dry leaves) to **1 part greens** (food).  
- Keep moist like a wrung sponge; add air pockets.

## Simple flow
Collect → mix with browns → aerate weekly → harvest when earthy and crumbly.

## Safety
Keep pests out with lids, bury scraps, and don’t add oils/meat to outdoor cold piles.

## Use it
Mulch beds, top‑dress pots, or sift for seed starting.
