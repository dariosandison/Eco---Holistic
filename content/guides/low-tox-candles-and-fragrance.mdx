    ## Low‑Tox Candles & Home Fragrance

    Low‑Tox Candles & Home Fragrance doesn’t have to be complicated. Below we explain what really matters, how to avoid common mistakes, and how to choose options that fit your budget and home.

### Why this matters
Good choices here affect health, comfort, and waste. The wrong pick costs more over time or simply goes unused. We focus on the few specs and habits that deliver outsized results.

**Key spec:** composition (wax, wick, fragrance type) and ventilation. Prefer cotton/paper wicks; burn for short sessions and ventilate after.

**Common mistakes:** burning too long, poor trimming, or using in unventilated small rooms.

### How to choose
- **Define the job**: room size, frequency of use, who’s using it.
- **Prioritise the spec that actually changes outcomes** (we call that out below for this category).
- **Total cost over 2–3 years**: filters/refills/consumables and expected lifespan.
- **Noise & ease**: if it’s annoying, people won’t use it.

### Setup & use
Placement, simple routines, and basic maintenance usually move the needle more than chasing premium models. We include quick-start checklists so you get results on day one.

### Maintenance & lifespan
Set calendar reminders for filter changes or parts that wear. Clean monthly, review quarterly, replace annually (as appropriate for the category).

### FAQ
**Do I need the most expensive option?** Not usually—matching the size/spec to your situation matters more.

**What about ‘natural’ vs ‘synthetic’?** Safety depends on the context and concentration, not just the label.

### How we research (no freebies required)
We don’t buy or lab‑test products. Instead we compile manufacturer specs, independent lab tests from reputable outlets, standards and agency guidance, and verified owner feedback. Where data is unclear, we explain the trade‑offs so you can decide with eyes open.

    ## Quick-start checklist
    - Make one change that reduces waste/exposure this week.
    - Set a 3‑month reminder for maintenance or refills.
    - Track what you actually use; donate or recycle the rest.

    ### Original quick notes
    (The original bullets from this post appear below for reference.)

## Sane candle shopping
- **Waxes:** beeswax and soy blends burn cleaner than paraffin.  
- **Wicks:** look for **cotton/wood**, no metal cores.  
- **Fragrance:** many are fine in moderation—if sensitive, choose essential‑oil or unscented.

## Burn better
- Trim wick to 5 mm.  
- First burn: 1–2 h to edge to prevent tunnelling.  
- Keep away from drafts; snuff, don’t blow.

## Alternatives
- **Simmer pot:** citrus peel + spices.  
- **Fresh air habit:** 10‑minute purge after cooking.  
- **Small diffuser** with well‑diluted essential oils; avoid around pets and babies.

## Label red flags
“Parfum” with no allergen disclosure, no wick/wax info, heavy soot on test burns.

## FAQ
**Do “natural” candles remove toxins?** No. Best is reducing sources + ventilating.
