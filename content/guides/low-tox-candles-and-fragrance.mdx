## Sane candle shopping
- **Waxes:** beeswax and soy blends burn cleaner than paraffin.  
- **Wicks:** look for **cotton/wood**, no metal cores.  
- **Fragrance:** many are fine in moderation—if sensitive, choose essential‑oil or unscented.

## Burn better
- Trim wick to 5 mm.  
- First burn: 1–2 h to edge to prevent tunnelling.  
- Keep away from drafts; snuff, don’t blow.

## Alternatives
- **Simmer pot:** citrus peel + spices.  
- **Fresh air habit:** 10‑minute purge after cooking.  
- **Small diffuser** with well‑diluted essential oils; avoid around pets and babies.

## Label red flags
“Parfum” with no allergen disclosure, no wick/wax info, heavy soot on test burns.

## FAQ
**Do “natural” candles remove toxins?** No. Best is reducing sources + ventilating.
