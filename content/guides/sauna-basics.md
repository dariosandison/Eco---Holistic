Sauna can be a calm reset: warmth relaxes muscles, you breathe deeper, and many people sleep better on sauna days. Here’s the simple, sensible way to start.

## Safety first (read this)
- Skip sauna if you feel unwell, have heat intolerance, or after alcohol.
- Speak to your clinician if you have cardiovascular issues, are pregnant, or take medications that affect sweating/hydration.
- Stand up **slowly** to avoid light-headedness.

## How to start (beginner)
- **Temp:** 70–85 °C (dry) or comfy in an infrared blanket/cabin.
- **Time:** 10–15 min, **1–2 rounds**, cool down in between.
- **Cool-down:** Sit, sip water; a cool shower if you like.
- **Hydration:** Drink before/during/after; add electrolytes if you sweat a lot.

## Frequency
- 2–4 times/week is plenty for most people. More isn’t always better—aim for consistency.

## Little upgrades that help
- Towel for sitting (hygiene and comfort).
- **Thermometer** to know your room/blanket temp.
- **Electrolytes** on sauna days.
