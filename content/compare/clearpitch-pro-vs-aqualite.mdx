### Why we picked Clearpitch Pro
If you want higher removal claims (42 **and** 53) with faster everyday flow, Clearpitch Pro wins. Choose Aqualite when cabinet space is the primary constraint or you want lower upfront price.

**Tip:** replace filters on schedule to maintain performance. Keep a reminder on your phone for 6–9 months ahead.
