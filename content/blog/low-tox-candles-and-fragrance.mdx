Home fragrance is one of those topics that can swing from *"it’s totally harmless"* to *"everything is toxic"*.
The truth is calmer:

- Many people tolerate scented products just fine.
- Some people get **headaches, irritation, or asthma symptoms** from certain fragrances or from heavy indoor scent.
- Burning anything indoors can add **particles (soot)** to the air.

This guide explains the *why* first — then the practical options.

<Note title="Big principle" type="info">
If you feel better in a less-scented home, the biggest win is **reducing constant fragrance sources** (plug-ins, sprays) and using **ventilation**. Candles become a *sometimes* thing, not a background habit.
</Note>

## Why fragrance can feel like a problem

Fragrance is usually a **mixture of many aroma chemicals**.
Even when products are compliant and safe for most users, a few things can still happen:

- **Sensory overload:** strong scent in a small, warm room can feel nauseating or headache‑y.
- **Airway irritation:** some people (especially with asthma/allergic rhinitis) react to certain scented products.
- **Sleep disruption:** heavy scent late evening can feel stimulating or cause congestion.

Also worth knowing: “fragrance-free” and “unscented” aren’t always the same. Unscented products sometimes include masking fragrance.

## Why candles can affect indoor air

Candles are small combustion sources.
Even “clean” candles can:

- release **fine particles** (especially if the wick is long or the flame is flickering)
- create **soot** if the candle smokes or tunnels
- add **scent load** (fragrance oils) into the air

This doesn’t mean you must avoid candles.
It means: burn them like you would a wood stove or frying pan — **with ventilation and good technique**.

## A simple, no‑spend plan (best starting point)

If your home often feels “stuffy”, or scent gives you headaches, try this for two weeks:

1. Remove **plug‑ins, sprays, and air fresheners**.
2. Ventilate after cooking: **open a window for 5–10 minutes**.
3. If you use laundry scent boosters or heavily fragranced detergent, switch to **fragrance‑free**.

That alone fixes the “constant background fragrance” effect for many people.

## If you still want a cosy scent

### Option 1: Make the air better first
A scent feels nicer when the air is fresh.
Try:

- crack a window while cooking
- use an extractor fan if you have one
- keep humidity steady (very damp air traps odours)

If your home has damp/mould issues, tackle **moisture and ventilation** first.

### Option 2: Burn candles more safely
Use these habits — they reduce soot and reduce “smoky” smell:

- **Trim the wick** to about 5 mm before lighting.
- **First burn:** let it melt to the edge (prevents tunnelling).
- **Avoid drafts:** flickering flames produce more soot.
- **Snuff rather than blow** to reduce smoke.
- **Ventilate** (especially in small rooms).

<Note title="Sensitive household note" type="warning">
If someone in the home has asthma, severe allergies, migraines triggered by scent, or you’re dealing with poor ventilation, treat candles like a “rare treat” — or skip them.
</Note>

### Option 3: Low‑smoke alternatives
- **Simmer pot:** citrus peel + cinnamon/cloves (super gentle).
- **Fresh herbs:** rosemary, mint, eucalyptus branches in a vase.
- **Baking:** yes, genuinely.

### Option 4: Diffusers (use with care)
Essential oils are “natural” but still potent.
If you use a diffuser:

- keep it **dilute**
- use it **for short windows** (not all day)
- avoid around **babies and pets** unless you’ve checked safety guidance

## What to look for when buying

You don’t need perfection — just basic transparency.
Look for:

- clear wax info (e.g., soy blend / beeswax / paraffin)
- wick material disclosure
- “fragrance-free” if you’re sensitive
- a candle that burns **without visible smoke** when used correctly

<Note title="Reality check" type="info">
Wax type matters less than **how you burn** and **how much fragrance you add to a small room**.
</Note>

## FAQs

**Are “natural” candles automatically safer?**
Not always. A heavily fragranced “natural” candle can still trigger headaches for sensitive people. Start with “low scent load” and good burn habits.

**Do scented candles ‘remove toxins’?**
No. The most effective approach is reducing sources (cooking smoke, damp, heavy fragrance) and ventilating.

**Is paraffin always bad?**
Not necessarily. The practical question is: does it smoke, does it smell too strong, and do you feel fine using it? If you’re sensitive, choose low‑scent options and ventilate.
