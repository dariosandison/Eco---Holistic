A good wind-down is short, repeatable, and boring (in a good way).

## The 20-minute template
1. Tidy one small area (2 min)
2. Warm drink (tea or water) (5 min)
3. Lights low + no scrolling (10 min)
4. One calming cue (stretch, breath, or reading) (3 min)

## Keep it consistent
Pick the same order each night. Consistency is the signal.
