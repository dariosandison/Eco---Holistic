If you’re in the UK, most tap water is **regulated and routinely tested** — so people usually filter for **taste, smell, limescale, and convenience**, not because the water is “unsafe”.

This guide helps you pick a filter based on *your actual problem* (taste, hardness, old plumbing, kettle scale), and avoid the two common mistakes:

1. Buying the wrong type of filter for the job
2. Buying a filter you won’t maintain

<Note title="This is an education-first guide" type="info">
If you have a health-related concern about drinking water (for example pregnancy, immunocompromise, or a known local issue), start with official sources and/or a clinician. Don’t guess.
</Note>

## Start with the real goal

Pick **one primary goal**:

- **Taste/odour** (chlorine taste, “swimming pool” smell)
- **Limescale/hard water** (kettle scale, soap not lathering, shower doors spotting)
- **Convenience** (cold filtered water ready to drink)
- **Specific concern** (e.g. old pipes, known local issue — rare, but possible)

Your goal determines your best option.

## What filters can and can’t do

### What most household filters do well
- Improve **taste and smell** (often via activated carbon)
- Reduce some **common trace contaminants** (varies by filter type)

### What they *don’t* reliably do
- Fix **hard water for your whole home** (you’d need a proper softening approach)
- Make up for poor maintenance (old filters can perform inconsistently)

<Note title="Hard water isn’t “dirty water" type="info">
Hardness is mainly calcium/magnesium minerals. It’s a practical issue (scale), not automatically a health risk.
</Note>

## The UK-specific step most people skip

Before buying anything:

1. **Check your water supplier’s reports** for your area (taste, hardness, and standard test results)
2. If your home is older, consider whether **internal plumbing** could be the issue

If your water suddenly changes colour, smell, or taste: **report it to your water company** rather than trying to solve it with a gadget.

## A simple “which filter type?” decision

### 1) Jug filter
Best for:
- Taste improvement
- Low cost
- Renting / small kitchens

Trade-offs:
- Needs regular cartridge changes
- Slower flow

### 2) Tap‑mounted / faucet filter
Best for:
- Taste + convenience
- Small households

Trade-offs:
- Fit can be awkward on some taps
- Cartridge changes still matter

### 3) Under‑sink (inline) filter
Best for:
- Higher capacity
- Less counter clutter
- Families who drink lots of water

Trade-offs:
- Installation effort
- Ongoing cartridge cost

### 4) Reverse osmosis (RO)
Best for:
- Specific scenarios where very broad reduction is desired

Trade-offs:
- Higher cost, more waste water, more complexity
- Often overkill for typical UK use

## No‑spend steps that often fix “taste”

Try these first for one week:

- **Chill tap water** in the fridge (taste often improves)
- Run the tap briefly if water has been sitting in pipes overnight
- Keep your kettle/descaler routine consistent (scale can affect taste)

If taste still bothers you, a simple carbon-based filter is usually the next step.

## If your concern is old plumbing

If you’re in an older property:

- Run the cold tap for a short time in the morning before filling a glass.
- If you have lead plumbing concerns, use official guidance and consider professional advice.
- A filter can help in some cases, but **identifying the plumbing issue** is the more important step.

## What to buy (after the basics)

<Note title="Maintenance is the hidden “feature" type="warning">
Whatever you buy, set a replacement reminder. A great filter used past its service life becomes unpredictable.
