If you want better health, movement is one of the highest-return things you can do.
Not because you need to “burn calories” — but because movement affects:

- **blood sugar and insulin sensitivity**
- **blood pressure and circulation**
- **sleep quality**
- **mood and stress**
- **joint health and back pain risk**

This is a simple plan that works for most people because it’s **repeatable**.

<Note title="Big principle" type="info">
Don’t chase the perfect workout. Chase the *repeatable* one.
</Note>

## Why movement helps even if your weight doesn’t change

Body weight is only one outcome.
Movement improves “how your body runs” through:

- better mitochondrial and cardiovascular function (walking/cardio)
- stronger muscles that act like a glucose sponge (strength training)
- improved joint range and tissue tolerance (mobility)

Even small improvements can feel like:

- less stiffness
- better energy
- fewer cravings
- fewer aches

## The simplest weekly plan

### Daily baseline
- **Walk 20–40 minutes** most days.
- If that sounds impossible, start with **10 minutes after one meal**.

### Two short strength sessions
Pick any two non-consecutive days (e.g. Tue + Fri):

**Session A (20–30 min)**
1. Squat pattern (chair sit-to-stand) — 3 x 8–12
2. Push pattern (incline push-ups) — 3 x 6–12
3. Pull pattern (band row or doorframe row) — 3 x 8–12
4. Carry (grocery bags) — 3 x 30–60 sec

**Session B (20–30 min)**
1. Hinge pattern (hip hinge / light deadlift pattern) — 3 x 8–12
2. Press pattern (pike push-up or dumbbell press) — 3 x 6–12
3. Split squat / step-ups — 3 x 8–12
4. Core (dead bug / plank) — 3 x 20–40 sec

### Two 5–10 minute mobility slots
Pick two days (or add them after your walk):

- hips: 90/90 or hip flexor stretch
- thoracic spine: open books
- ankles/calves: calf stretch

## How to progress without getting injured

Use a simple rule:

- When a set feels *too easy*, add **one rep** next time.
- When you hit the top of the rep range comfortably, add a small load (heavier band/dumbbell).

Keep 1–3 reps “in the tank” most of the time.

## Common barriers (and simple fixes)

**“I don’t have time.”**
Start with 10 minutes after one meal. That’s enough to build the habit.

**“I get sore and quit.”**
Do less. Soreness is a sign you did too much too soon.

**“I don’t know what to do.”**
Use this page as your template for 8 weeks. Don’t change it weekly.

## When gear actually helps

You can do the plan with no equipment.
If you want one upgrade:

- **a set of resistance bands** or **one adjustable dumbbell**
