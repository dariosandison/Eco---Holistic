## Why this matters
Switching to “eco” can get expensive fast. Here’s a short list of **under‑£25** changes that make the biggest daily impact—no gimmicks.

## Quick wins (prioritised)
1. **Refillable washing‑up soap** (or solid dish bar). Lower plastic, less filler. Works in hard water if labelled for it.
2. **Microfibre‑catching laundry bag** for synthetics. Cuts microplastic shedding when you can’t avoid polyester.
3. **Two good cloths** (cellulose sponge + cotton waffle). Replace disposable wipes and paper towels.
4. **Stainless water bottle** you’ll actually carry. Hydration > novelty features.
5. **Bicarbonate + white vinegar** cleaning duo. Great for descaling, deodorising, glass (avoid vinegar on natural stone).

## Kitchen swaps
- **Glass food storage** (1–2 containers). See food → less waste. Oven/reheat safe.
- **Unpaper towels** (10–12 sheets). Use for counters, veg drying. Wash warm; line‑dry.
- **Compost caddy + liners** (if council allows). Reduces bin smell; diverts food scraps.

## Laundry under £25
- **Fragrance‑free powder** over liquid; better in hard water, lighter footprint.
- **Stain stick** (soap + enzymes) for collars, baby clothes, period underwear.

## Body & home
- **Fragrance‑free moisturiser** with short INCI list (e.g., shea, glycerin, squalane).
- **Beeswax/soy candle** with cotton wick. Burn 1–2 hours; trim wick to 5 mm.

## What to skip (for now)
- Fancy “bioplastic” gadgets, single‑purpose cleaners, and anything you’ll store rather than use.

## Routine that works
- Refill dish + laundry monthly.
- Keep two cloth types visible.
- Do a **Sunday 10‑minute reset**: refill sprays, wash cloths, prep lunch box.

## FAQ
**Will this save money?** Yes—less food waste and disposables typically offsets the swaps in 1–2 months.
**I rent—worth it?** Definitely. These are portable habits and items.
