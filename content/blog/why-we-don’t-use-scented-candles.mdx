## The short version
We skip heavily fragranced candles because we prefer to keep indoor air simple at night (especially in winter when windows are closed).

## What we do instead
- **Open-window moments** when weather cooperates  
- **Essential oils (light)** in a water humidifier, not all evening  
- **Non-toxic cleaners** for kitchen smells (soap + water is still king)  

If bedroom air feels stale overnight, our testers had the best results with a quiet purifier—see **[Bedroom Air Purifiers](/guides/bedroom-air-purifiers)**.
