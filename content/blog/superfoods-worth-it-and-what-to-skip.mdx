“Superfood” is mostly a marketing word — but some foods *are* worth buying because they’re convenient ways to add nutrients and fibre.

The trick is focusing on the basics.

## A simple rule: choose foods, not claims

If a product is yelling about:

- detoxing
- boosting hormones
- melting fat
- “cleanse” effects

…treat that as marketing.

## Superfoods that are often useful

- **Chia seeds**: easy add‑in for oats/yoghurt and a fibre boost.
- **Ground flaxseed**: another simple fibre add‑in; good for baking too.
- **Olive oil (EVOO)**: everyday staple that helps meals taste good.
- **Fermented foods**: useful if you like them — not magic, but can be a good addition.

## What to skip (most of the time)

- “Proprietary blends” where you can’t see doses
- Products with lots of flavours and sweeteners
- Anything selling certainty (health is rarely that neat)

## Practical shortlists

- [chia seeds (UK): shortlist](/best-chia-seeds-uk)
- [ground flaxseed (UK): shortlist](/best-ground-flaxseed-uk)
- [extra virgin olive oil (UK): shortlist](/best-extra-virgin-olive-oil-uk)

If you’re consistent with basics, you don’t need exotic powders to make progress.
