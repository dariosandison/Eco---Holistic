In winter, UK homes often swing between **too dry** (heating running) and **too damp** (condensation + laundry drying). The goal isn’t a “perfect number” — it’s a stable, comfortable range.

<Note title="Measure first" type="info">
The single best first step is a cheap hygrometer. Without it, people often buy the wrong device (humidifier when they needed ventilation, or vice versa).
</Note>

## What humidity actually is (in plain English)

- **Relative humidity (RH)** is how “full” the air is with water vapour at that temperature.
- Warm air can hold more moisture, so RH changes when you heat a room.

That’s why a home can feel dry once the heating is on — even if you haven’t removed any moisture.

## Why it matters

Humidity affects three practical things:

1. **Comfort** (dry skin, dry throat, static)
2. **Mould risk** (persistent high humidity + cold surfaces = condensation)
3. **Dust mites** (they thrive more easily when humidity is consistently high)

## A practical target range

For most homes, a sensible aim is roughly **40–60% RH**.

- Below ~35–40%: many people notice dryness.
- Above ~60% (especially for long periods): condensation and mould risk rise.

<Note title="Don’t chase one reading" type="info">
Take readings morning and evening for a week. Look for patterns, not a single number.
</Note>

## The main causes (and the quickest fixes)

### 1) Condensation on windows
This usually means **humidity is high** and surfaces are cold.

Fixes:
- Ventilate the wet rooms (kitchen/bathroom) after use
- Keep doors closed while extracting
- Heat steadily (big swings create cold surfaces)

### 2) Laundry drying indoors
This is one of the biggest winter moisture sources.

Fixes:
- Dry with a window slightly open + door closed
- Use a dehumidifier in the drying space if humidity stays high
- Avoid drying in bedrooms if possible

### 3) “Dry air” symptoms
If humidity is low, it’s often because heating is drying the air *relative* to its capacity.

Fixes:
- Reduce overheating
- Keep nighttime temperatures comfortable but not tropical
- If RH is genuinely low (consistently under ~35–40%), consider a humidifier — **but only after measuring**

## No‑spend winter humidity plan

1. Buy/borrow a **hygrometer** and track RH for 7 days.
2. Add **ventilation bursts** after moisture events (showers, cooking).
3. Keep internal doors to wet rooms closed while extracting.
4. Make laundry drying intentional (one space, with airflow).
5. If humidity stays high, a dehumidifier is the most direct tool.

## When to buy a device

### Dehumidifier
Best for:
- Condensation and mould risk
- Laundry drying indoors
- Persistently high readings

### Humidifier
Best for:
- Confirmed low humidity (consistently low readings)
- Nighttime dryness symptoms

Start here:
- [Humidifiers for bedrooms (UK) shortlist →](/best-humidifiers-for-bedrooms-uk)

<Note title="Cleaning matters" type="warning">
Humidifiers need regular cleaning. If that’s not realistic, don’t buy one.
</Note>

## When to get help

If you have:
- Visible mould returning quickly
- A persistent leak, damp patches, or disrepair

…treat it as a housing issue, not a “buy a gadget” issue.
