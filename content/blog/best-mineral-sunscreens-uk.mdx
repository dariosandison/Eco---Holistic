# What to Know About Mineral Sunscreens in the UK

Mineral filters (**zinc oxide**, sometimes with **titanium dioxide**) can offer stable, broad‑spectrum protection with lower irritation risk. The trade‑offs are potential **white cast** and thicker textures.

## TL;DR
- Look for **tinted** or **micronised** zinc oxide formulas for lower white cast.
- In the UK, check for the **UVA circle** mark and aim for high UVAPF/Boots **4–5★**.
- Daily wear matters more than chasing SPF 50+ you won’t reapply.

## What to Avoid
- “Natural” claims with **insufficient UVA protection**.
- Sprays you can inhale; opt for lotions or sticks.
- Heavy fragrances if you’re sensitive.

## How to Choose
- **Filters:** zinc oxide 15–25% is common for broad coverage.
- **Texture:** gel‑cream or silicone‑based formulations tend to glide better.
- **Tint:** sheer tints help balance cast on many skin tones.
- **Label cues:** water‑resistant claims help for sport; avoid “reef‑safe” greenwash.

## Application Basics
- Use **2–3 finger lengths** for face/neck.
- Reapply every **2 hours outdoors**; less often indoors unless next to big windows.
