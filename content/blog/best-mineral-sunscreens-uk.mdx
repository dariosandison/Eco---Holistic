## Key points
- **Filters:** zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide.  
- **Finish:** tinted options reduce white cast.  
- **Texture:** gels and fluid lotions wear better under makeup.  
- **Broad spectrum & SPF 30–50**; apply enough (two‑finger rule for face).

## Sensitive skin
Fragrance‑free, minimal silicones, patch‑test.
