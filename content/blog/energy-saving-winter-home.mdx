## Priority order
1) **Seal drafts** around windows/doors; heavy curtains at night.  
2) **Targeted heating:** heat the room you use; consider a heated throw.  
3) **Humidity ~45%** feels warmer; avoid >60% to prevent mould.  
4) **Water:** insulate tank/pipes; fix dripping taps.  
5) **Appliances:** 30 °C washes, air‑dry, full loads.

## Small habits
Cook with lids, batch bake, shut doors, and air rooms briefly (fast purge) instead of trickling all day.
