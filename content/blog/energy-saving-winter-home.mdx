# A Warmer, Cheaper Winter at Home

Improve comfort first; gadgets second.

## TL;DR
- Aim for **19–21°C** living spaces, **16–18°C** bedrooms.
- Fix **drafts**, add **thermal curtains**, and manage **humidity 40–50%**.
- Heat the **person** (layers, hot water bottles) before the whole house.

## Practical Wins
- **Door seals**, chimney balloons, radiator reflectors.
- **Timed heating** and zoning.
- **Ventilate** kitchens/baths to prevent condensation and mold.
