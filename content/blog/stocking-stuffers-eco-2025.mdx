# Gift Ideas That Support Well‑Being (and the Planet)

Experiences and consumables beat dust‑collecting stuff.

## Ideas
- **Classes or workshops:** cooking, pottery, foraging.
- **Consumables:** beeswax candles, herbal teas, bath salts.
- **Quality basics:** wool socks, glass storage, a great mug.

## How to Keep It Low‑Waste
- Wrap with **reused paper** or **cloth furoshiki**.
- Include a **handwritten note** with care tips.

> **Methodology & Transparency**
>
> We haven't begun hands‑on testing yet. Our selections and guidance are based on:
> third‑party certifications, published test data, reputable standards bodies, material and ingredient disclosures,
> regulatory guidance, and aggregated owner feedback. When we start receiving samples to test,
> we’ll update each piece with measurements and photos.
>
> We don’t do pay‑to‑play. If you spot an error or have data we should add, email hello@wild-and-well.store.
