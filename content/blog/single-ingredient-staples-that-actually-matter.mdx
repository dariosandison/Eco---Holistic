When nutrition advice gets noisy, it helps to step back and ask:

**What foods can I buy that make it easier to eat well on autopilot?**

That usually means **single‑ingredient staples**.

## The staples (and why they work)

- **Oats**: cheap, flexible, easy breakfast base.
- **Olive oil (EVOO)**: a useful everyday fat that makes simple meals taste good.
- **Beans/lentils**: fibre + protein + convenience.
- **Frozen veg**: it’s there when you don’t have energy.
- **Fruit**: the easiest “snack upgrade”.
- **Eggs / yoghurt / tinned fish**: simple protein anchors.

## Where the problems sneak in

Modern shopping makes it easy to buy “health” products that are basically sweets with vitamins.

A quick filter:
- If the ingredient list is long and reads like a lab, it’s probably a **product**, not a **food**.

## If you buy staples online, what to look for

- **Freshness cues** (harvest/best-before dates where relevant)
- **Storage** (dark glass for oils; resealable pouches for seeds)
- **Simplicity** (avoid unnecessary flavours/sweeteners)

## Favourites shortlists

- [extra virgin olive oil (UK): shortlist](/best-extra-virgin-olive-oil-uk)
- [organic oats (UK): shortlist](/best-organic-oats-uk)
- [fermented foods to start with: shortlist](/best-fermented-foods-sauerkraut-kimchi)

This isn’t “perfect nutrition.” It’s a system that makes good decisions easier.
