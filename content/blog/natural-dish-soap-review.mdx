## Key criteria
- **Surfactants:** look for plant‑derived (e.g., alkyl polyglucosides) and clear ingredient lists.  
- **Fragrance:** unscented or low‑allergen disclosure.  
- **Hard water performance:** check label or choose a solid dish bar formulated for minerals.  
- **Packaging:** concentrates and refills reduce plastic.

## At the sink
- Use hottest comfortable water; soak greasy pans; a **scraper + brush** saves soap.  
- Rinse thoroughly—residue can cause spots and skin dryness.

## Sensitive skin?
Gloves help. Choose fragrance‑free and moisturise after longer sessions.

## Bottom line
Pick a formula you’ll happily refill and use daily; consistency beats novelty.
