# Dish Soap: Low‑Tox Essentials

You need grease‑cutting without harsh residues.

## TL;DR
- Look for **anionic + amphoteric** surfactant blends (e.g., **SLES** + **coco‑betaine**) for performance with lower irritation than SLS alone.
- **Unscented** or **naturally scented** options help if you’re sensitive.
- Skip antibacterial claims for everyday use.

## Ingredient Red Flags
- **MI/MCI** preservatives if you’re reactive.
- Heavy **synthetic dyes** and strong perfumes.

## Use Tips
- Hot water + a short soak beats over‑dosing soap.
- Rinse boards/bottles thoroughly.
