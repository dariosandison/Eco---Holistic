# Reusable Water Bottles: Materials & Hygiene

Hydration is easier when the bottle fits your routine.

## TL;DR
- **18/8 stainless** is durable; choose **wide‑mouth** for cleaning.
- **Double‑wall vacuum** keeps drinks cold/hot longer.
- Wash lids/gaskets **daily**; deep‑clean weekly.

## Materials
- **Stainless steel:** tough, no plasticiser risk.
- **Glass:** pure taste, heavier.
- **Plastic (PP/TRITAN):** light; replace if cloudy or scratched.

## Hygiene
- Disassemble lids; soak in **bicarbonate**.
- Air‑dry fully to prevent biofilm.
