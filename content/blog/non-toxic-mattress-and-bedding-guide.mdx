## Quick comparison

| What you want | Our pick | Why |

**Want the shortcuts?** [Shop our favourites for this topic →](/picks)

- **Natural latex + wool + cotton:** breathable, durable; higher upfront cost, long life.  
- **Polyfoam/memory foam:** affordable; look for **CertiPUR‑US** or **OEKO‑TEX**.  
- **Springs + natural top layers** can balance budget and breathability.

## Certifications to know
- **GOTS** (textiles), **GOLS** (latex), **OEKO‑TEX Standard 100**, **FSC** (wood), **CertiPUR‑US** (foam).

## Picking your mattress
- Side sleepers: softer top (pressure relief). Back/stomach: medium‑firm.  
- Hot sleepers: coil + latex or breathable cover.  
- Allergies: zipped, washable encasement; vacuum mattress top monthly.

## Bedding priorities
- 100% cotton or linen sheets; wash weekly at 40–60 °C.  
- Wool or cotton duvets for moisture control; avoid heavy fragranced softeners.

## Budget moves
- Upgrade **pillows** and **encasement** first; they affect airways most.

## FAQ
**Do I need all‑natural?** Not always. Focus on breathable covers and credible certifications.
