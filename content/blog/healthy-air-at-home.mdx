Most people think “air quality” means **buying an air purifier**.
In a normal UK home, the biggest wins are usually **moisture control, ventilation, and a few high-impact habits**. Purifiers help — but they’re step 2, not step 1.

## What “indoor air quality” actually means

Think of indoor air as four buckets:

1. **Particles** (dust, pollen, pet dander, cooking smoke, outdoor pollution that drifts indoors)
2. **Moisture + mould** (humidity, condensation, damp patches)
3. **Gases / VOCs** (from sprays, fragrances, paints, new furniture, some cleaning products)
4. **Allergens + irritants** (a mix of the above, plus things like strong scents)

You don’t need to “detox your home”. You need to **reduce what’s building up** and **increase removal/dilution**.

## Why it matters (real-life impact)

For many households, better indoor air shows up as:

- Fewer **morning allergy symptoms** (especially if the bedroom is cleaner and less dusty)
- Less **coughing, throat irritation, or “stuffy” nights**
- Fewer **mould flare-ups** and musty smells
- Less **headache/irritation** for people who are scent-sensitive

You don’t have to aim for perfection. Aim for **fewer bad days**.

## The biggest drivers in UK homes

These are the patterns we see most:

- **Cooking without extraction** (especially frying): particles build up fast
- **Indoor laundry drying** without ventilation: humidity rises, condensation appears
- **Bathrooms/kitchens with weak fans** (or fans that don’t vent outside)
- **Bedrooms with lots of soft furnishings** (dust reservoirs) + inconsistent bedding washing
- **Heavy fragrance use**: candles, plug-ins, sprays, scent boosters
- **Damp/condensation** from cold surfaces, leaks, or poor airflow

## A 10‑minute home check

You can learn a lot quickly:

- **Do you get window condensation most mornings?** That’s a moisture signal.
- **Does the home smell musty** in corners, wardrobes, or behind furniture?
- **Do symptoms feel worse at night/on waking?** Start with the bedroom.
- **Do you have an extractor that vents outside?** (Many don’t.)
- **Is humidity regularly above ~60%?** A cheap hygrometer is one of the best small purchases you can make.

<Note title="A good target" type="info">
A practical range for comfort + mould risk is often ~40–60% relative humidity. Measure first; don’t guess.
</Note>

## No‑spend improvements that work

### 1) Ventilation “bursts” (not all-day draughts)
- After cooking/showering: **10–20 minutes** of ventilation.
- Keep doors to wet rooms **closed while extracting**.
- If outdoor air is poor (traffic), ventilate at **quieter times**.

### 2) Make cooking less smoky
- Use lids, lower heat, and preheat less aggressively.
- If you don’t have an extractor that vents outside, open a window while frying.
- Wipe grease build-up (it holds odour and particles).

### 3) Bedroom basics
- Wash bedding weekly at the warmest appropriate temperature.
- Vacuum mattress + floor regularly (HEPA vacuum is a bonus, not required).
- Reduce clutter around the bed (dust collects).

### 4) Run a 2‑week “fragrance reset” if anyone is sensitive
Remove the biggest sources first:
- Scent boosters / fabric conditioner
- Plug‑ins and sprays
- Candles (temporarily)

Then reintroduce one at a time if you want to.

## When products help (and which ones are worth it)

### Air purifier: when it makes sense
A purifier is most useful when:
- You have **allergies** (pollen, dust, pets)
- You live near **traffic** and can’t always ventilate
- You want a cleaner bedroom overnight

**How to choose (quick version):**
- Match it to your room size (this is the #1 reason people don’t see results)
- Prefer **true HEPA** from a reputable brand
- Consider **carbon** if odours are the issue
- Check **replacement filter cost** and noise

### Dehumidifier: when it’s the more direct fix
If you see **condensation + recurring mould**, a purifier won’t solve the root cause.
A dehumidifier can help when humidity stays high despite reasonable ventilation.

## If you have damp or mould

1. **Measure humidity** and look for moisture sources (laundry drying, poor extraction, leaks).
2. **Ventilate the wet rooms properly** and keep internal doors closed while extracting.
3. **Heat steadily** rather than extreme on/off spikes (cold surfaces condense moisture).
4. If it’s rental disrepair (leaks, penetrating damp), **document and escalate**.

<Note title="When to get help" type="warning">
If mould is extensive, keeps returning quickly, or you have persistent/worsening respiratory symptoms, use official guidance and seek support (housing advice or a clinician).
