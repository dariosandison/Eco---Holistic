# Bamboo Toilet Paper: Greener—or Greenwash?

Bamboo grows fast and can beat virgin wood pulp on footprint—**but** process and transport matter.

## TL;DR
- Prefer **unbleached** or **TCF** options; avoid heavy plastic wrap.
- Look for **FSC** certification and transparent sourcing.
- UK‑made recycled can be lower‑carbon than imported bamboo.

## What to Check
- **Pulping & bleaching** method disclosure.
- **Sheet size** and **ply** (comfort vs waste).
- Packaging: paper wraps and bulk boxes.
