## The quick take
Bamboo grows fast and uses less land than trees, but **processing and bleaching** decide the final footprint.

## What actually matters
- **Fibre source:** certified bamboo or recycled content; avoid unknown mixed pulp.  
- **Bleach method:** **TCF/PCF** preferred; avoid elemental chlorine.  
- **Additives:** skip heavy fragrance/lotions.  
- **Packaging:** paper‑only is ideal.

## Transport & softness
Shipping impact is real but often smaller than fibre/chemicals over a product’s life. Multi‑ply softness varies by brand—try a small pack first.

## Verdict
Better than virgin tree pulp when **certified and minimally processed**. Recycled paper still wins on waste reduction.
