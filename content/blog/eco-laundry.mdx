## The routine
- **Detergent:** powder, fragrance‑free; dose for water hardness.  
- **Temperature:** 30–40 °C for most loads; 60 °C for towels/bedding occasionally.  
- **Microfibre care:** use a catching bag when washing synthetics.

## Stains
Pre‑treat quickly with a soap or enzyme stick; sun helps on whites.

## Drying
Air‑dry when possible; clean lint filters to improve efficiency.

## Skin‑friendly
Extra rinse for baby/skin‑sensitive loads.

## FAQ
**Liquids vs powders?** Powders often clean better in hard water and ship less water.
