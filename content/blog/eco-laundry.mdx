Laundry is one of the biggest “hidden” exposure points in a normal home.
Not because you’re doing anything wrong — but because laundry combines:

- **direct skin contact** (all day)
- **fragrance and preservatives** (often stronger than you realise)
- **heat + humidity** (especially when drying indoors)
- **synthetic fibres** (microfibres that can shed during washes)

This guide is about **how and why** those things matter — then a simple routine that fixes most of it.

<Note title="Big principle" type="info">
The best laundry upgrades are mostly **behavioural**: dose correctly, stop fabric softener, ventilate when drying, and keep fragrance low.

## Why laundry can affect health and comfort

### 1) Skin irritation and dermatitis
Laundry residue sits on the skin for hours.
If you’re prone to eczema, itchy skin, or “mystery” irritation, laundry is a common (and fixable) contributor.

What drives the problem most often:

- **Fragrance** (including essential oils) — a common trigger for sensitive skin and headaches.
- **Over‑dosing detergent** — leaves more residue behind.
- **Fabric softener** — designed to leave a coating behind; often heavily fragranced.
- **Hot washes + harsh products** — can make fibres rougher and feel scratchier.

### 2) Indoor air and headaches
Drying indoors (especially on radiators) adds moisture to the air.
More humidity can mean:

- more condensation
- higher mould risk in cold corners
- musty smells that people try to “solve” with more fragrance

### 3) Microfibres and water impact
Synthetic fabrics can shed microfibres when washed.
You don’t have to throw your wardrobe away — but you *can* reduce shedding and choose better over time.

## The simple routine (low effort, high impact)

### Step 1: Stop fabric softener
It’s the easiest win.
If you want softness:

- use the correct **detergent dose**
- don’t overload the machine
- line dry with a bit of movement (shake clothes out before hanging)

### Step 2: Dose detergent for your water
Hard water needs a bit more detergent; soft water needs less.
If your clothes feel “waxy” or your towels stop absorbing well, over‑dosing is a common reason.

<Note title="Hard water tip" type="info">
If you’re in a hard-water area, powders often perform well for everyday washing.
</Note>

### Step 3: Choose sensible temperatures
- **30–40°C**: most everyday loads
- **60°C**: towels/bedding occasionally, or when you want a hygiene reset

You don’t need to boil everything. Consistency matters more than extremes.

### Step 4: Rinse strategy (for sensitive skin)
If anyone in the home is very sensitive:

- add **one extra rinse** on bedding and underwear
- avoid heavily fragranced products entirely

## Stains: what actually works

- **Act fast**: the longer a stain sits, the harder it sets.
- **Pre-treat** with a small amount of detergent or a gentle stain soap.
- **Sunlight** helps on whites (when weather allows).

Avoid mixing random stain removers. Use one method at a time.

## Drying without mould problems

### Line dry when you can
It’s cheaper and reduces dryer wear.

### If you dry indoors
- crack a window or use extraction
- don’t dry directly on radiators if possible
- keep air moving (even a small fan helps)

If you’re already dealing with damp, pair good laundry habits with the basics from our humidity guide:

## Microfibres: reduce shedding without drama

You don’t have to avoid synthetics entirely.
Use these rules instead:

- wash synthetics **less often** when possible
- wash on **gentler cycles** and avoid high heat
- wash full loads (less abrasion)
- consider a **microfibre-catching bag** for synthetic workout gear

Over time, prioritise natural fibres for basics you wear a lot (cotton, linen, wool).

## Buying framework (when you do replace products)

### Detergent
Look for:

- **fragrance-free** or very low fragrance
- clear dosing instructions
- a product that works in your local water

### Fabric softener
Skip it.
If you *must* use something for static, start with dryer balls and see if that’s enough.

## FAQs

**Liquids vs powders?**
Powders often clean well in hard water and ship less water (lower transport weight). Liquids can be convenient for short cycles.

**Do “natural” detergents always irritate less?**
Not necessarily. “Natural” can still mean fragranced. The most reliable signal for many people is simply **fragrance-free**.

**Should I use disinfectant laundry additives?**
Only when there’s a reason (illness in the home). For normal laundry, cleaning and drying well is usually enough.
