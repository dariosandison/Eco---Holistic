Strength training doesn’t need a perfect gym plan. It needs a routine you’ll actually repeat.

## The simplest structure

Two or three sessions per week is enough for most beginners.

Each session can be:

- a squat pattern (sit-to-stand, split squat)
- a push (push-ups on a wall/bench/floor)
- a pull (bands rows)
- a hinge (hip hinge / glute bridge)
- carries/core (optional)

## Start bodyweight, then add bands (optional)

Resistance bands are one of the best “small space” tools because they are cheap, light, and flexible.

## Keep it boring (in a good way)

If your routine is too complicated, you won’t do it.

Pick 5 movements, keep the reps sensible, and progress slowly.
