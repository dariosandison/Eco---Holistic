Most “low‑tox kitchen” advice is either **too extreme** (bin everything!) or **too vague** (just detox!).

Here’s a calmer way to think about it:

1. **Heat changes things.** Heat increases fumes and increases migration from surfaces into food.
2. **Wear matters.** Scratched, flaking, or degraded surfaces are where “maybe fine” becomes “replace it”.
3. **Habits beat shopping.** A few repeatable rules get you most of the benefit.

<Note title="Big principle" type="info">
The highest-impact kitchen habits are: **ventilate while cooking**, **avoid plastic + heat**, and **replace damaged non‑stick**.
</Note>

## Why the kitchen is a high-impact area

Your kitchen combines three things that make exposures more likely:

- **Heat** (hob/oven/air fryer)
- **Food contact** (surfaces that touch what you eat)
- **Indoor air** (fumes in a closed space, especially winter)

So the goal isn’t “perfect purity”. It’s reducing the *common, repeatable* sources of irritation and avoidable risk.

## The common problems (plain English)

### 1) Cooking fumes & indoor air
High heat can create **smoke, particles, and strong smells**. Even without burning, frying and searing produce airborne particles.

**Why it matters:** if you’re prone to headaches, asthma symptoms, or just feel “stuffy” after cooking, this is often the real culprit — not some mysterious toxin.

**What helps most:** use the extractor, crack a window, and reduce pan smoking (lower heat, enough oil, don’t over-preheat empty pans).

### 2) Plastics + heat
Plastic is most likely to be an issue when it’s:

- heated (microwave, hot food, dishwasher heat)
- scratched/aged
- used repeatedly with fatty/acidic foods

You don’t need to purge every plastic item. But it’s sensible to avoid **heat + plastic** as a rule.

### 3) Worn non‑stick
Non‑stick is convenient. The main “low‑tox” rule is simple:

- **Use low-to-medium heat**
- **Don’t preheat empty pans**
- **Replace when scratched or flaking**

If your non‑stick pan looks “sandpapery” or flakes, it’s not a kitchen heirloom — it’s a replace-it item.

## No-spend wins first

Do these for 2 weeks before buying anything:

1. **Ventilate while cooking**
   - extractor on + crack a window for 5–10 minutes after.
2. **Lower the heat**
   - most meals don’t need pan-smoking temperatures.
3. **Stop microwaving food in plastic**
   - tip into a ceramic/glass bowl.
4. **Cool leftovers before sealing**
   - hot food + sealed plastic is the combo to avoid.
5. **Use a “replace when damaged” rule**
   - scratched non‑stick, warped plastic, cracked lids → replace gradually.

## The calm starter kit (buy once, use daily)

If you want to upgrade without overbuying, this order gives the best value:

### 1) Storage that makes leftovers easy
- **Glass containers** for leftovers
- **Silicone lids / stretchy covers** for odd bowls

Why this is high impact: it reduces plastic-in-heat and makes eating leftovers easier (less waste, more real-life nutrition wins).

### 2) One workhorse pan that can take heat
Choose one:

- **Stainless steel** (most versatile; great for searing)
- **Enamelled cast iron** (great heat retention; heavier)
- **Well-seasoned cast iron** (simple, durable; needs care)

Keep non‑stick if you like — just treat it as a specialist tool (eggs, low heat) and replace when worn.

### 3) A safer “tiny kit” for cleaning
Kitchen cleaning doesn’t need a chemical parade.

- fragrance-free dish soap
- microfibre cloth
- bicarbonate of soda for scrubbing
- citric-acid descaler for limescale

## Materials cheat sheet

Use this as a simple “good enough” guide:

- **Great defaults:** stainless steel, enamelled cast iron, glass, ceramics, wood (well cared for), silicone (for lids)
- **Fine with rules:** non‑stick (low heat, replace when damaged), plastic (avoid heat)
- **Where to be cautious:** anything heavily scented, items that are old/scratched/peeling, unknown coatings with no disclosure

## Buying checklist (so you don’t get greenwashed)

When comparing products, look for:

- **What it’s made of** (clearly stated materials)
- **How it’s used** (will it touch hot food? go in a hot dishwasher?)
- **How you’ll clean it** (easy to clean = you’ll actually use it)
- **Weight & storage** (if it’s annoying, it becomes cupboard clutter)

Avoid marketing-only claims like “detox”, “chemical-free”, or “purifies toxins”. Look for **materials, use limits, and care instructions**.

## FAQ

**Do I need to throw away all plastic?**
No. The practical rule is **avoid heat + plastic** and replace obviously worn items over time.

**Is stainless steel always “better” than non‑stick?**
It’s often more durable and heat-tolerant. But if you hate cooking on it, it won’t help. A mixed kitchen (one non‑stick + one stainless) works well.

**What about air fryers and ovens?**
The same principle applies: avoid burnt food and heavy smoke, ventilate, and keep surfaces clean.
