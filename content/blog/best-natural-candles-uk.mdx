# Natural Candles in the UK: Wax, Wicks, and What to Avoid

Candles set a mood—but indoor air quality matters too.

## TL;DR
- Prefer **beeswax** or **soy/rapeseed blends** with **cotton wicks**.
- Keep burns **1–2 hours**, trim wicks to **5 mm**, and ventilate.
- Avoid heavy **synthetic fragrance** if you’re scent‑sensitive.

## Wax Choices
- **Beeswax:** long burn, natural honey note.
- **Soy/Rapeseed:** good scent throw; check for sustainability claims.
- **Paraffin:** affordable but more soot potential.

## Label Literacy
- Look for **IFRA‑compliant** fragrance disclosure and allergen notes.
- Choose **clear jars** to spot tunnelling and soot.
