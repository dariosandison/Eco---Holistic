Small changes can make a big difference. Before we get to picks, this primer explains **why this topic matters for everyday wellbeing** and how to make smart, low‑effort upgrades that last.

### What matters most
- **Real‑world impact first:** Favor changes you’ll use daily over niche optimizations.
- **Evidence over hype:** Materials, certifications, and maintenance beat marketing claims.
- **Fit to your life:** Choose options you can easily clean, store, and afford to keep using.

> **Holistic angle**  
> We’re after calmer homes, better sleep, steadier energy — not perfection. The best swap is the one you actually keep.

> **Bottom line**  
> Start with the highest‑exposure items you touch or breathe around most, then expand at your own pace.

## Top picks & why

- Clean wax blend, cotton/wood wick, realistic scent names.
- Burn test: even pool, minimal soot, wick trims keep it tidy.

No. Prioritize the items you use every day. Layer improvements over 60–90 days.
