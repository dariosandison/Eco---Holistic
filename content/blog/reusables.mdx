## Start with friction points
- Coffee on the go? **Collapsible cup** kept in bag.  
- Lunch leaks? **Steel box + leakproof pot**.  
- Shops often? **Nesting totes** in the car/coat.

## Make it visible
Store by the door/sink/desk. If you can’t see it, you won’t use it.

## Clean & maintain
Simple washing rules, no fiddly parts, occasional deep clean with bicarb/vinegar (not on stone).
