Walking is underrated because it looks too simple. But if you do it consistently, it improves fitness, mood, and daily energy for most people.

## The real goal: consistency

Instead of obsessing over one perfect number, aim for a **weekly rhythm**:

- A daily “minimum walk” you can always do (even 10–15 minutes)
- A couple of longer walks when life allows

## How to progress without getting fancy

Pick one knob to turn:

- add 5 minutes
- add one extra day per week
- add a small incline (if available)
- carry a light backpack sometimes

## Useful gear (optional)

- Comfortable shoes matter more than anything.
- A simple tracker can help some people stay consistent.

No gimmicks. Just repeatable movement.
