1. **Parfum/Fragrance** as a catch-all  
2. **Antibacterials** like quats for routine cleaning  
3. **Optical brighteners** in laundry  
4. **Aerosols** for everyday use  
5. **Unnecessary dyes**  
6. **Confusing “green” claims** without detail  
7. **Huge ingredient lists** you can’t parse

## Why this matters for holistic wellbeing

The choices you make around **ingredient red flags** affect more than convenience — they influence indoor air quality, potential irritants, stress levels, and your environmental footprint. This guide emphasises simple habit changes that support your health first; products are optional helpers.

## Practical routine to start today

1. **Simplify** — remove the extras you rarely use; fewer products means fewer exposures.
2. **Swap the highest‑impact item first** — choose fragrance‑free or naturally scented options and short ingredient lists.
3. **Ventilate** — fresh air reduces build‑up of indoor pollutants from cooking, cleaning, and off‑gassing.
4. **Be consistent** — small, repeated choices around ingredient red flags add up.

## Ingredient red flags to avoid

- **"Fragrance/Parfum" catch‑all** — can hide dozens of chemicals; choose fully disclosed scents or fragrance‑free.
- **Harsh disinfectants for daily use** — reserve quats/strong biocides for when they are truly needed.
- **Unnecessary dyes & brighteners** — cosmetic only; they add exposure without benefit.
- **Greenwashing terms** — “non‑toxic”, “chemical‑free”, “eco‑friendly” without specifics. Prefer full ingredient lists or credible standards.

## Research snapshot

- Lower product complexity and proper ventilation correlate with **better indoor air quality**.
- People sensitive to fragrance report fewer symptoms when **fragrance‑free** policies are adopted.
- Choosing durable, repairable items generally has **lower lifecycle impact** than frequent replacement.

_These are broad findings intended for context, not medical advice._
