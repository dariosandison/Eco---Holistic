# Ingredient Red Flags (With Nuance)

Short lists help you shop quickly—context keeps it accurate.

## Often Worth Avoiding
- **Fragrance** if you’re sensitive; prefer unscented or simple essential oils.
- **Quats** in routine cleaners; reserve for disinfection.
- **PFAS** in stain‑repellent coatings.

## Nuance
- **“Natural” ≠ safer**; many botanicals are potent allergens.
- **Dose and exposure** matter more than scary names.
