## Common red flags
- **Undisclosed “parfum/fragrance”** in leave‑on products.  
- **Formaldehyde releasers** (DMDM hydantoin, quaternium‑15).  
- **Phthalates** (often hidden in fragrance).  
- **Strong quats** in daily cleaners (benzalkonium chloride) when not needed.

## Better patterns
- Short INCI lists, fragrance‑free or clearly disclosed allergens, gentle surfactants (glucosides).  
- For cleaners: clear ingredients and dilution guidance.

## Remember
Dose and context matter; choose the gentlest product that does the job.
