## What to look for
- **Borosilicate or toughened glass**, oven‑safe (no lids in oven unless rated).  
- **Reliable lids:** snap‑lock or stainless with silicone inserts.  
- **Sizes:** 370–500 ml for sides; 800–1200 ml for mains; shallow for lasagne/freezing.

## Care
Cool before lidding; avoid thermal shock; replace lids rather than whole sets.
