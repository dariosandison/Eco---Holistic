# Glass Food Containers: Safer Storage That Lasts

Glass beats plastic for hot leftovers, oven reheat, and long‑term food safety.

## TL;DR
- Choose **borosilicate** or **tempered** glass with **silicone‑lined lids**.
- Avoid lids with **mystery coatings** or poorly sealed snaps.
- For oven use, remove lids; let hot glass **cool before washing**.

## What to Look For
- **Glass:** borosilicate resists thermal shock; tempered soda‑lime is strong but avoid broilers.
- **Lids:** silicone gasket, BPA‑free PP, easy‑clean crevices.
- **Sizes:** a mix of **1–1.5 L** mains and **0.3–0.7 L** sides works well.

## Care
- Skip abrasive pads; check gaskets periodically.
- Stains? Soak briefly with **baking soda + hot water**.
