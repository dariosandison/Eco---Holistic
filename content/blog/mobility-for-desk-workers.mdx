If you sit for hours, the problem usually isn’t “tight hips” alone — it’s **hours of one position**.

A short daily reset often helps more than an occasional intense session.

## The 10-minute reset

Try this sequence:

1. 1 minute: easy breathing + slow neck turns
2. 2 minutes: thoracic rotations (open books)
3. 2 minutes: hip flexor stretch (gentle)
4. 2 minutes: hamstring hinge (soft knees)
5. 2 minutes: ankle rocks + calf stretch
6. 1 minute: easy squat hold (as tolerated)

## Optional tools

- A mat makes it more comfortable.
- A foam roller can help with stiffness (use gently).

The goal isn’t perfect flexibility. It’s movement that feels easier tomorrow.
