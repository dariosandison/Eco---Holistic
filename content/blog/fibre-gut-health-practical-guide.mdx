If there’s one nutrition “upgrade” that shows up again and again, it’s **more fibre**.

Not because fibre is trendy — but because modern diets make it unusually easy to eat lots of calories with very little fibre.

## Why fibre matters

Fibre is linked with:

- Better digestive regularity
- Improved satiety (you feel full)
- Healthier blood sugar response (for many people)
- Supporting a diverse gut microbiome (what you feed the microbes matters)

You don’t need perfect numbers. You need **repeatable habits**.

## Why people struggle in 2026

A few modern realities:

- Many “healthy” snacks are still low-fibre
- Convenience foods crowd out legumes/veg
- People fear carbs, so they avoid fibre-rich foods like oats and beans

## The simplest ways to add fibre (no spreadsheet required)

Pick **two** of these and you’re already ahead:

1. **Oats** (porridge / overnight oats)
2. **Beans/lentils** (a tin into a meal twice a week)
3. **Berries** (frozen is fine)
4. **Seeds** (chia or ground flax)
5. **Veg at lunch and dinner** (one “extra veg” default)

## Smart supplements vs real food

If you’re considering a fibre supplement, start with food first. If you still want a supplement, keep it simple and increase slowly — and be mindful of your tolerance.
