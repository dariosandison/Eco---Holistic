## What truly matters
- **Skin‑safe basics:** fragrance‑free wash, plain moisturiser (e.g., shea + glycerin).  
- **Breathable sleep space:** firm mattress, fitted sheet, bare cot.  
- **Air & laundry:** ventilate; use fragrance‑free powder; extra rinse for new textiles.

## Gear list (minimal)
- 2–3 cotton fitted sheets, 4–6 muslins, 2 blankets (cotton/wool).  
- Changing mat + water + cloths; nappy balm with simple ingredients.  
- Car seat per safety rating; second‑hand is fine **only** if history known.

## Bath & skin
- Infrequent bathing is okay. Moisturise damp skin. Patch‑test new products.

## Home environment
- Vacuum with HEPA, damp‑dust weekly.  
- Avoid plug‑in fragrances and strong cleaners.

## Feeding notes
- If using bottles: choose reputable materials (PP, glass), clean thoroughly, air‑dry.

## FAQ
**Do I need “baby‑specific” everything?** No—gentle, simple household products often work well.
