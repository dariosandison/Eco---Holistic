Modern food is convenient, cheap, and everywhere — and that convenience has a downside. A lot of what we eat now falls into the **ultra‑processed** category.

This article is not about moralising food. It’s about understanding the environment we’re in, and making upgrades that are realistic.

## What counts as “ultra‑processed”?

A useful way to think about it:

- **Unprocessed/minimally processed:** fruit, veg, eggs, oats, plain yoghurt, beans, meat/fish.
- **Processed culinary ingredients:** oils, butter, salt, sugar.
- **Processed foods:** canned tomatoes, bread with a short ingredient list, cheese.
- **Ultra‑processed foods (UPFs):** products formulated from many ingredients, often including **additives** like emulsifiers, flavours, sweeteners, colours, and “modified” starches.

UPFs aren’t just “food with ingredients.” They’re usually engineered for shelf life and palatability.

## Where UPFs show up in everyday life

Common places you’ll find them:

- “High protein” snack bars and shakes
- Flavoured yoghurts and “breakfast” cereals
- Ready meals, fast food, packaged sandwiches
- “Low‑fat” products with lots of stabilisers
- Many sauces, dressings, and spreads

You don’t need to eliminate these to benefit. The aim is **reduce reliance** — especially when they start replacing real meals.

## What research tends to suggest

Across a growing body of research, **high UPF intake is associated with poorer health outcomes**. This doesn’t mean every UPF is “toxic”, but it’s a consistent enough pattern to take seriously.

If you want accessible voices discussing this:
- **Dr. Chris van Tulleken** (author and doctor) has talked widely about UPFs.
- **ZOE** (nutrition science team) and **Prof. Tim Spector** often discuss how modern diets affect metabolism and gut health.

## The most useful practical steps

These are the upgrades that work for most people:

1. **Build meals around single‑ingredient staples** (veg, fruit, eggs, oats, beans, fish, potatoes, rice).
2. **Choose the simplest version of a product first** (plain yoghurt over flavoured; oats over sugary cereal).
3. **Make one “default” breakfast** that’s repeatable.
4. **Treat snacks like food**: fruit, nuts, yoghurt, tinned fish, leftovers.
5. **Keep ultra‑processed foods as optional extras**, not meal foundations.
