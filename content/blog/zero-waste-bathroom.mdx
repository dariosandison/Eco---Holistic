Perfection isn’t the goal — **steady, low‑effort habits are**. This guide focuses on the few moves that cut the most exposure and clutter while keeping your routine simple.

### Start here (first 90 days)
1. **Tackle daily touchpoints:** Upgrade the one thing you handle most (e.g., cookware, storage, cleanser).
2. **Create a simple rule:** One swap per month; set a reminder to revisit after 30 days.
3. **Make maintenance obvious:** Keep refills and filters where you’ll see them so the habit sticks.

> **Why it matters**  
> Heat and time increase leaching and breakdown. Moving plastics away from heat and choosing durable materials reduces exposure without changing your recipes or routines.

> **TL;DR:** Replace disposables in order of cost-per-use: safety razor, refillable soap, concentrated cleaner, and a durable toothbrush handle.

## Start with the highest savings

- **Safety razor** — blades cost pennies and give a closer shave.

- **Hand + body soap refills** — keep a pump, refill from a bulk container.

- **All-purpose concentrate** — one bottle, multiple uses.

## Optional upgrades

- Recycled or bamboo **toilet paper**  
- **Shampoo bar** if your water isn’t too hard

## Keep it realistic

Pick one swap per month. Track the saving versus what you used before.

## FAQ
**Is stainless, glass, or cast iron always better?**  
They’re durable and inert for most uses. Pick based on how you cook and clean.

**What if budget is tight?**  
Replace worn items first. Borrow, buy used, or upgrade one staple at a time.
