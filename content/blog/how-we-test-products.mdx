## Principles
- **Experience first:** we use the products in normal routines.
- **Measure the right thing:** light bands, particle counts, setup time, maintenance cost.
- **Show trade-offs:** pros, cons, and who each pick is for.

For a real example of how this plays out, read our **[NightView Amber Pro Review](/reviews/nightview-amber-pro-review)** and **[Water Filters for Apartments](/guides/water-filters-apartments)**.
