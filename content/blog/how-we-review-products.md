We earn a small commission if you buy through some links on this site. That income helps us keep the
site independent and free for readers. Hereâ€™s our process:

1. Start with evidence or a clear use-case.
2. Filter for safety, materials, and serviceability.
3. Prefer third-party certifications.
4. Compare value against peers.
5. Disclose what we don't know.

**Affiliate policy:** all affiliate links use `rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"`. We never accept
sponsored posts. If a product changes, we update or remove the recommendation.
