## The three‑piece kit
- **Tinted moisturiser or light foundation** with mineral SPF if desired.  
- **Cream colour** (cheeks/lips).  
- **Brow gel or pencil** to frame the face.

## Shopping tips
- Prefer **fragrance‑free**, mineral pigments, and clear allergen disclosure.  
- Patch‑test. Fewer layers usually = fewer issues.

## Removal
Oil or balm cleanser, warm water, soft cloth. No sting, no tugging.
