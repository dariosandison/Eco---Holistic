Small changes can make a big difference. Before we get to picks, this primer explains **why this topic matters for everyday wellbeing** and how to make smart, low‑effort upgrades that last.

### What matters most
- **Real‑world impact first:** Favor changes you’ll use daily over niche optimizations.
- **Evidence over hype:** Materials, certifications, and maintenance beat marketing claims.
- **Fit to your life:** Choose options you can easily clean, store, and afford to keep using.

> **Holistic angle**  
> We’re after calmer homes, better sleep, steadier energy — not perfection. The best swap is the one you actually keep.

> **Bottom line**  
> Start with the highest‑exposure items you touch or breathe around most, then expand at your own pace.

1. Tinted moisturiser  
2. Concealer

No. Prioritize the items you use every day. Layer improvements over 60–90 days.

**Is “natural” always safer?**  
Not necessarily. Look for well‑understood materials, third‑party testing, and clear care instructions.
