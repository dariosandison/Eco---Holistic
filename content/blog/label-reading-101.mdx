# Label‑Reading 101

Marketing is loud; the label is law.

## What to Focus On
- **INCI lists** (cosmetics) and full **ingredient panels** (cleaners).
- **Certification marks:** GOTS, GOLS, OEKO‑TEX, FSC, Fairtrade, NSF.
- **Lot codes** and **best‑by** dates for perishables.

## Red Flags
- Vague “**eco‑friendly**” claims without proof.
- Missing contact details or country of origin.

> **Methodology & Transparency**
>
> We haven't begun hands‑on testing yet. Our selections and guidance are based on:
> third‑party certifications, published test data, reputable standards bodies, material and ingredient disclosures,
> regulatory guidance, and aggregated owner feedback. When we start receiving samples to test,
> we’ll update each piece with measurements and photos.
>
> We don’t do pay‑to‑play. If you spot an error or have data we should add, email hello@wild-and-well.store.
