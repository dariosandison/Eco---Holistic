## Read past the front
Flip the pack. Look for **full ingredient lists**, certifications with numbers, and care/use instructions.

## Cut the noise
Terms like “eco”, “natural” or “non‑toxic” aren’t regulated. Focus on specifics: *fragrance‑free*, *phosphate‑free*, *certified*.

## Three‑step scan
1) What is it for? 2) What are the risks in *my* home? 3) Is there a simpler option?

## Keep notes
The best routine is the one you can repeat. Snap a photo of winners.
