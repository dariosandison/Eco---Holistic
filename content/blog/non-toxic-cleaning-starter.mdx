“Non‑toxic cleaning” is a messy phrase. Almost everything is “toxic” at the wrong dose.
What most people really want is:

- fewer strong smells and sprays
- less skin irritation
- good results without harsh chemical mixes

This guide is the simplest way to get there.

<Note title="Big principle" type="info">
The easiest win is **air + contact reduction**: stop spraying into the air, ventilate, and use fragrance‑free basics.
</Note>

## Why cleaning products can cause problems

Most issues are practical, not mysterious.
Cleaning products affect us mainly through **breathing** and **skin contact**.

### 1) Fragrance (including essential oils)
Fragrance is a mixture of aroma chemicals. Many people tolerate it, but for some it can trigger:

- headaches
- a “stuffy” feeling
- irritation in asthma/allergies

If someone in your home is scent‑sensitive, cleaning + laundry are often high‑impact places to start.

### 2) Sprays and aerosols
Sprays hang in the air. Even “natural” sprays can be irritating if you’re breathing droplets.
A simple shift is to **spray onto a cloth**, not into the air.

### 3) Over-disinfecting
A lot of modern marketing pushes “kills 99.9%”.
But many surfaces only need **cleaning (soil removal)**, not disinfection.
Overuse can increase skin irritation and strong fumes — without improving outcomes.

### 4) Frequent hand contact
If you wipe and spray a lot, you’re increasing skin exposure.
That matters most for people prone to eczema/contact dermatitis.

## The calm starter kit

You don’t need 15 bottles. Start with these 6 items:

1. **Microfibre cloths** (or cotton cloths)
2. **A gentle dish soap** (fragrance‑free if possible)
3. **An all‑purpose cleaner** (or diluted dish soap in a spray bottle)
4. **Bicarbonate of soda** (for gentle scrubbing)
5. **Citric acid** (or a dedicated descaler) for limescale
6. **Rubber gloves** (if your hands get irritated)

That covers ~90% of normal home cleaning.

## A simple routine that actually sticks

### Kitchen (daily-ish)
- Wipe counters with **soapy water** (soil removal is the goal).
- For grease: a bit more dish soap + warm water.
- For smells: ventilate; don’t mask with a spray.

### Bathroom (weekly-ish)
- For soap scum: warm water + dish soap.
- For limescale: use **citric acid** or a dedicated descaler (follow the label).

<Note title="Surface note" type="warning">
Acids (including vinegar/citric acid) can damage natural stone. If you have marble/stone, use a stone‑safe cleaner.
</Note>

### Floors
- Start with vacuuming/sweeping.
- Mop with diluted soap; skip heavily fragranced floor products.

## What not to mix (important)

Never mix products unless the label explicitly says it’s safe.
The big ones to avoid:

- **Bleach + ammonia** (dangerous fumes)
- **Bleach + acids** (dangerous fumes)

If you use bleach, use it **alone**, in a well‑ventilated space, and only when you genuinely need disinfection.

## When you actually need disinfecting

Disinfecting can make sense for:

- raw meat prep areas (after cleaning)
- illness in the household
- high‑touch surfaces during outbreaks

For normal everyday cleaning, **removing dirt/grease** is usually enough.

## A 2‑week fragrance reset (optional, powerful)

If you suspect fragrance is bothering you, do a short reset:

1. Remove **air fresheners, sprays, plug‑ins**
2. Switch laundry to **fragrance‑free**
3. Use fewer cleaning products (just the starter kit)

Then reintroduce one product at a time if you want to.

## How to choose products without overthinking

If you do buy cleaners, prioritise:

- **fragrance‑free** or very low fragrance
- **non‑spray formats** where possible (liquids, concentrates)
- clear dilution instructions
- a short ingredient list and clear hazard labelling
