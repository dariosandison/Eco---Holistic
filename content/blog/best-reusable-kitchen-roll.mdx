# Reusable Kitchen Roll: What Works, What Doesn’t

Paper waste adds up. Reusables save money and bins.

## TL;DR
- **Cellulose‑cotton “Swedish” cloths** are absorbent and machine‑washable.
- **Bamboo fleece** is soft for dusting; cotton terry for spills.
- Keep **10–12 pieces** in rotation and line‑dry to extend life.

## Care & Hygiene
- Hot wash weekly; quick rinse after greasy jobs.
- Refresh with a **bicarbonate + hot water** soak monthly.
