## Quick checklist
- **True HEPA or HEPA‑class** filter, stated **CADR** appropriate for room size.  
- **Noise:** low ~20–30 dB on sleep mode.  
- **Filter cost & schedule:** can you maintain it?

## Placement & use
Near the source (bed/desk), away from walls. Run on low continuously during pollen/dust events.
