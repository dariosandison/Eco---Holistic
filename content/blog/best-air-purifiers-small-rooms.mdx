# Small‑Room Air Purifiers: How to Choose

For bedrooms and home offices, sizing and filter quality matter more than gimmicks.

## TL;DR
- Target **5+ ACH** (air changes/hour) in small rooms; use CADR ≈ **room_volume × ACH / 60**.
- Choose a **sealed HEPA (H13/H14) + carbon** unit; avoid ionisers/ozone.
- Prioritise **noise under ~30–40 dB** on night mode and **low filter costs**.

## Key Specs
- **CADR (PM2.5):** match to room size; bigger is usually better.
- **Noise & power:** quiet and efficient = more hours run.
- **Filter price cadence:** annual cost affects total ownership.

## Setup Tips
- Place **away from walls/curtains**.
- Run **24/7 on low**; boost during cooking, cleaning, or wildfire events.
