## Decide by water & workload
- **Hard water + lots of pots:** stronger formula or **solid bar** made for minerals.  
- **Soft water + sensitive skin:** mild, fragrance‑free liquid; gloves optional.  
- **Hand‑wash only kitchen:** consider a concentrated refill system.

## Make any soap work harder
- Pre‑soak, scrape, hottest comfortable water, good tools (brush + cloth).  
- Measure—don’t glug.

## Environment
Refills and concentrates usually reduce plastic and transport impact the most.
