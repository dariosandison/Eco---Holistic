Protein is one of the few nutrition topics that *actually* earns the hype.
Not because you need a supplement — but because protein supports:

- **muscle and strength** (especially as you get older)
- **satiety** (staying full)
- **recovery** (training, illness, injury)

This guide explains the *why*, then gives you a simple, UK-friendly way to do it.

<Note title="Big principle" type="info">
You don’t need “perfect”. Most people do well by building **one solid protein anchor per meal**.
</Note>

## What protein does in the body

Protein is made of amino acids. Your body uses them to build and repair tissue, make enzymes and hormones, and support immune function.

Where it shows up in real life:

- If your protein is low, you may feel hungrier sooner after meals.
- If you’re building strength, protein helps you *keep* the muscle you earn.
- If you’re dieting, protein helps preserve lean mass (so weight loss is more likely fat than muscle).

## How much do you need?

There isn’t one “right” number for everyone.
A calm, practical approach is to aim for a *reasonable range* and adjust based on your appetite, body size, and activity.

Two simple ways to think about it:

1. **Per-meal approach (easiest):** include a protein food at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
2. **Hand-portion approach:** 1–2 palm-sized portions of protein per meal for many adults.

If you have kidney disease or medical conditions that change protein needs, speak to your clinician.

## The common reasons people struggle

- **Breakfast is mostly carbs** (toast, cereal) → hunger comes back fast.
- **Snacks replace meals** → easy to miss protein.
- **Cooking feels like effort** → you default to quick, low-protein options.

The fix is almost always “make one protein option easy and repeatable.”

## UK-friendly protein anchors

Pick a few you genuinely like and rotate them.

### Animal-based
- eggs
- Greek yogurt / skyr
- chicken thighs or breast
- tinned fish (tuna, sardines, salmon)
- lean mince, turkey, or beef

### Plant-based
- tofu and tempeh
- lentils and chickpeas (tinned is fine)
- edamame
- beans + whole grains together (e.g., beans + rice)

## Easy meal templates

### Breakfast
- Greek yogurt + fruit + oats + nuts
- eggs + toast + fruit
- protein smoothie (milk/soy milk + yogurt + fruit)

### Lunch
- tuna/egg mayo sandwich + salad
- leftovers from dinner
- bean/lentil soup + bread + cheese

### Dinner
- “protein + veg + carb” (e.g., chicken + frozen veg + rice)
- chilli (mince or lentils) + rice
- tofu stir-fry + noodles

## Do you need protein powder?

Not usually.
It can be useful if you:

- struggle to eat enough due to appetite or time
- have higher needs from training

But it’s optional. Food-first works well for most people.

## Quick checklist

- Add **one protein anchor** to breakfast.
- Keep **one easy lunch** (tuna/eggs/yogurt/leftovers).
- Make dinner a simple template you repeat.
