Creatine is one of the most researched supplements in sport nutrition. It’s not magic — but if you train (especially strength/sprints), it can be one of the **highest “return on simplicity”** add‑ons.

## At a glance
- **What it does:** helps recycle energy (ATP) during short, high‑effort work.
- **Who it suits best:** lifting, sprinting, team sports, and anyone trying to gain strength over time.
- **How to take:** **3–5g creatine monohydrate daily** (loading is optional).

## What creatine is (in plain English)
Your body already stores creatine in muscle. When you do short, intense work (heavy sets, sprints), creatine helps your cells **regenerate energy faster**. Over weeks of consistent training, that can mean:
- a little more work done per session (reps, sets, sprint efforts)
- better training consistency
- strength and lean‑mass gains *when combined with training*

## How to take creatine
### The simplest approach
- Take **3–5g once daily**, every day.
- Timing is flexible. If you prefer a routine, take it **with a meal**.

### Loading (optional)
Loading can speed up muscle saturation, but it’s not required.
- **20g/day** split into 4 x 5g doses for 5–7 days
- then **3–5g/day** as maintenance

If loading upsets your stomach, skip it.

## What to look for when buying

Most people do best with **simple creatine monohydrate**. If you choose a “blend” or added formula, just make sure the label is transparent and you can still hit a sensible daily dose.

- **Creatine monohydrate** (simple, well‑studied)
- transparent dosing (avoid formulas that hide amounts)
- easy mixing (micronised powders tend to mix better)

## Common myths (quick answers)
- **“You need to cycle creatine.”** Most people don’t. Consistency is the main lever.
- **“It’s only for bodybuilders.”** It can suit anyone doing short‑effort work — including beginners.
- **“It’s a stimulant.”** It isn’t. Creatine doesn’t work like caffeine.

## Safety notes
Creatine is widely used, but safety depends on the person.

<Note>
This is general information, not medical advice. If you have kidney disease, are pregnant/breastfeeding, are under 18, or take medication for a condition, check with a qualified clinician before supplementing.
</Note>

## How to make it “actually stick”
- Keep it visible (next to your kettle/coffee, or next to your protein).
- Use a scale if you like precision, but **a standard scoop** is fine if it matches the label.
- Treat it like **a habit**, not a “boost” — results come from weeks of consistent training.
