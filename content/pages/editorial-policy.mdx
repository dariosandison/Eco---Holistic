# Editorial Policy

Our goal is to help you make confident decisions with **clear trade-offs** and **independent testing**.

## How we pick topics
We prioritize everyday problems with outsized impact: sleep latency, air and water quality, stress downshifts, and practical movement.

## Testing
- **Measure what matters:** spectra (400–520 nm), PM counts, dBA, setup time, ongoing cost.
- **Use in real life:** evenings, small flats, travel days.
- **Pros/cons:** each review shows where a pick is strong and where it isn’t.

## Independence & disclosures
- We buy products or accept review units with **no guarantee** of coverage.
- Affiliate links are marked with `rel="nofollow sponsored"`.
- See our **[Affiliate Disclosure](/legal/affiliate-disclosure)** and **[Product Disclosure](/legal/product-disclosure)**.

## Corrections & updates
We fix mistakes and timestamp updates at the top of the page.
