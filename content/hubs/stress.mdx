## Practical Steps
1. Set a simple goal for the next 2 weeks related to **Stress**.
2. Create a low-friction routine (5–10 min a day is fine) and stack it onto an existing habit.
3. Log your energy, mood, and sleep — review weekly to see what’s working.
4. Make one eco-friendly swap that aligns with this topic (choose reusable over disposable where possible).


## Common Mistakes & Myths
- **All-or-nothing thinking:** small consistent steps beat short intense bursts.
- **One-size-fits-all:** bodies and lifestyles differ; personalize your approach.
- **Overlooking basics:** hydration, movement, and sleep amplify most Stress practices.


## FAQs

No. It can complement your routine, but it’s not a replacement for diagnosis or treatment. Speak with a healthcare professional for medical concerns.

**How long until I notice benefits?**  
It varies. Many people assess changes after 2–4 weeks of consistent practice.

The best time is the one you’ll *actually* do consistently. Anchor it to an existing habit.
