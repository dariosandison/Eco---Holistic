## Foundations that compound

**Why it matters:** Sleep, light, movement, and hydration—the 80/20 of feeling better.

### Key Takeaways
- Keep it simple and consistent; small wins compound.
- Track how you feel weekly; adjust based on your own data.
- Choose the lowest‑effort eco swap that you’ll actually keep.

### Practical Steps
1. Set one habit you can do in under 10 minutes.
2. Stack it onto something you already do (coffee, lunch, bedtime).
3. Review on Sundays for 5 minutes—celebrate progress.
