# Affiliate Disclosure

We’re reader-supported. If you buy through links on Wild & Well, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you. This helps fund our testing and writing.

## What this means for recommendations

- We only recommend products we use or research deeply.  
- Affiliate relationships never guarantee inclusion or “best” status.  
- All paid links are qualified with `rel="nofollow sponsored"`.
