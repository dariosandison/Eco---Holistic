We independently **research and recommend products** that align with our values (low-tox, simple ingredients, durability, value).

### How we choose
- Hands-on use where possible, plus spec checks and ingredient/material reviews.  
- Preference for transparent brands and evidence-informed claims.  
- No sponsored posts; picks can change as products change.

### Affiliate links
Some links may be **affiliate links** â€” if you buy through them, we may earn a small commission **at no extra cost to you**. This helps keep Wild & Well free and reader-supported.

### No pay-to-play
Brands cannot buy placement or influence our picks. Our views are our own.

### Updates
We revisit guides and recommendations over time. Pricing and availability can change.
