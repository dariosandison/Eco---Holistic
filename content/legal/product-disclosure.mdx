## Why Product Disclosure matters
Product Disclosure can play a role in a whole-person approach to wellbeing when paired with foundational habits like sleep, movement, and stress management. Below is a simple, practical guide you can adapt to your lifestyle.

# Product Disclosure

Products referenced on Wild & Well may be purchased by us or sent by brands as review units. Receiving a unit does not guarantee coverage or a positive review.

## Review units

- We disclose any material connection where relevant.
- Loaned products are returned unless otherwise stated.
- We do not sell positive placement or paid “best” badges.

## Corrections

If we make a mistake, we fix it and timestamp the update on the page.

## Key Takeaways
- Product Disclosure can support a holistic lifestyle when combined with sleep, movement, stress management, and nutrition.
- Results vary — track how you feel and adjust gradually.
- Avoid absolute claims; pair with advice from a qualified professional if you have a health condition.


## Practical Steps
1. Set a simple goal for the next 2 weeks related to **Product Disclosure**.
2. Create a low-friction routine (5–10 min a day is fine) and stack it onto an existing habit.
3. Log your energy, mood, and sleep — review weekly to see what’s working.
4. Make one eco-friendly swap that aligns with this topic (choose reusable over disposable where possible).


## Common Mistakes & Myths
- **All-or-nothing thinking:** small consistent steps beat short intense bursts.
- **One-size-fits-all:** bodies and lifestyles differ; personalize your approach.
- **Overlooking basics:** hydration, movement, and sleep amplify most Product Disclosure practices.


## FAQs
**Is Product Disclosure a substitute for medical care?**  
No. It can complement your routine, but it’s not a replacement for diagnosis or treatment. Speak with a healthcare professional for medical concerns.

**How long until I notice benefits?**  
It varies. Many people assess changes after 2–4 weeks of consistent practice.

**Is there a “best” time of day?**  
The best time is the one you’ll *actually* do consistently. Anchor it to an existing habit.

**Can I combine Product Disclosure with other practices?**  
Usually yes — pair it with gentle movement, breathwork, quality sleep, and balanced nutrition.
